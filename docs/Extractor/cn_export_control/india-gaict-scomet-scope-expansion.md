## Summary

India's DGFT issued Notification No. 26/2024-2025 on October 7, 2024, amending Appendix 10M to expand the scope of dual-use items, software, and technology covered under the Global Authorization for Intra-Company Transfer (GAICT) for SCOMET-listed items.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), India
- **Effective Date:** 2024-10-07 (notification release date)
- **Scope:** Amendments to Appendix 10M in Section 10.15 of Handbook of Procedures (HBP) under 2023 Foreign Trade Policy (FTP); expansion of SCOMET dual-use items, software, and technology eligible for GAICT

## Key Provisions

1. **Notification Number**: DGFT Notification No. 26/2024-2025
2. **Regulatory Amendment**: Modifies Appendix 10M in HBP Section 10.15 under the 2023 Foreign Trade Policy
3. **Scope Expansion**: Expands range of SCOMET (Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment, and Technologies) list items covered by GAICT
4. **Item Categories**: Dual-use items, software, and technology added to GAICT eligibility
5. **Streamlined Procedures**: GAICT facilitates export and re-export of controlled items among multinational company internal operations to countries/regions listed in HBP Section 10.15, Table 1
6. **Intra-Company Transfer Focus**: Authorization specifically for transfers within same multinational corporate group, not general export licenses

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **MNC Efficiency Gains**: Multinational corporations with India operations gain streamlined procedures for transferring SCOMET-controlled dual-use items, software, and technology to internal facilities in approved destinations, reducing licensing delays
- **Geographic Limitations**: GAICT only applies to destinations in HBP Section 10.15, Table 1 (likely allied/friendly nations); transfers to non-listed countries still require individual licenses
- **Technology Transfer Facilitation**: Expansion may particularly benefit software and technology transfers for R&D collaboration, engineering support, and technical services within multinational corporate structures
- **Semiconductor and Electronics**: India's growing electronics manufacturing sector likely benefits from easier intra-company transfer of dual-use manufacturing equipment and technology from parent companies
- **Defense Industry Impact**: India's defense manufacturers partnering with foreign OEMs may benefit from streamlined access to dual-use technologies under GAICT, supporting "Make in India" and defense production initiatives
- **Compliance Simplification**: GAICT reduces administrative burden vs. individual export licenses, but companies must ensure transfers meet intra-company criteria and destination eligibility

## Notes

GAICT (Global Authorization for Intra-Company Transfer) is a facilitative licensing mechanism allowing pre-approved exports/re-exports within multinational corporate groups without individual licenses for each transaction. SCOMET list is India's dual-use control list, broadly aligned with international export control regimes (Wassenaar, NSG, MTCR, Australia Group).

The expansion suggests India balancing export control rigor with facilitating legitimate business needs of multinational corporations, particularly in high-tech manufacturing and R&D sectors. Specific items added to GAICT scope not detailed in source article.
