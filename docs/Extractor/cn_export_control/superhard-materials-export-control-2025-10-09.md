## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement 2025 No. 55 on October 9, 2025, implementing export controls on superhard materials including synthetic diamond products and chemical vapor deposition equipment, effective November 8, 2025. The controls target micropowder, single crystals, wire saws, grinding wheels, and DCPCVD technology used in advanced manufacturing.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce & General Administration of Customs (商务部 & 海关总署)
- **Effective Date**: November 8, 2025
- **Scope**: Synthetic diamond materials, tools, and production equipment/technology

## Key Provisions

**Legal Basis:**
- Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China
- Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China
- Customs Law of the People's Republic of China
- Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations

**Controlled Items:**

1. **Synthetic Diamond Micropowder**
   - Average particle size ≤50 μm
   - Used in precision grinding and polishing applications

2. **Synthetic Diamond Single Crystals**
   - Size range: 50 μm < size ≤500 μm
   - Excludes decorative/jewelry diamonds
   - Used in cutting tools and industrial applications

3. **Synthetic Diamond Wire Saws**
   - Meeting specific technical specifications
   - Used in silicon wafer cutting for semiconductors

4. **Synthetic Diamond Grinding Wheels**
   - Defined hardness and speed parameters
   - Precision machining applications

5. **DCPCVD Equipment**
   - Direct Current Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition equipment
   - Used for synthetic diamond production

6. **DCPCVD Process Technology**
   - Manufacturing know-how and technical specifications

**Compliance Requirements:**

**For Exporters:**
- Apply to the commerce department for export licenses per regulations
- Mark controlled items as "dual-use items" on customs declarations with control codes

**For Customs Declaration:**
- Items must indicate controlled status with specific commodity codes
- Borderline products require "non-controlled" status marking with detailed specifications
- Customs will withhold release if documentation accuracy is questionable

**Dual-Use Items Export Control List Update:**
The list will be updated to reflect these new control categories.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Affected Industries:**

1. **Semiconductor Manufacturing**:
   - Diamond wire saws are critical for silicon wafer slicing in chip production
   - China dominates global diamond wire saw production (>70% market share)
   - Potential supply disruptions for global semiconductor fabs

2. **Precision Machining**:
   - Diamond grinding wheels and micropowder essential for ultra-precision manufacturing
   - Aerospace, automotive, and medical device sectors affected
   - Tool and die manufacturing dependencies

3. **Advanced Materials Production**:
   - DCPCVD technology controls limit establishment of new synthetic diamond production capacity outside China
   - Vertical integration challenges for non-Chinese manufacturers

4. **Electronics and Optics**:
   - Diamond materials used in heat sinks, optical components, and wear-resistant coatings
   - 5G/6G infrastructure components

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **Semiconductor Supply Chain Chokepoint**: Diamond wire saws are essential for wafer production, and China's dominant position in production creates vulnerability for global chip manufacturing.

2. **Technology Transfer Restrictions**: DCPCVD equipment and process technology controls prevent establishment of competing production capacity, maintaining China's technological advantage.

3. **Dual-Use Nature**: While marketed for industrial applications, superhard materials have military applications in:
   - Precision-guided munitions components
   - Aerospace cutting tools
   - Advanced armor and protective systems

4. **Licensing Process**:
   - Additional lead time for export license approval
   - Potential denials for sensitive end-users or military applications
   - Compliance documentation burden

**Market Impact:**
- **Short-term**: Supply chain disruptions, price increases for controlled items
- **Medium-term**: Push for alternative sourcing and domestic production in importing countries
- **Long-term**: Potential fragmentation of global superhard materials market

**Affected Regions:**
- Major semiconductor manufacturing countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, U.S.)
- Precision manufacturing hubs (Germany, Switzerland, Japan)
- Emerging manufacturing economies dependent on Chinese tooling

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full announcement retrieved. This control is particularly significant for semiconductor manufacturing, as diamond wire saws have become the industry standard for silicon wafer slicing, replacing traditional slurry-based methods. China's dominant position in synthetic diamond production (both quantity and advanced DCPCVD technology) gives it substantial leverage. The timing aligns with broader controls on semiconductor-related materials and technologies announced in October 2025 (rare earths, lithium batteries).
