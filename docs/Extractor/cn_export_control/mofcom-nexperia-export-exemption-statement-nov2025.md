## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce addressed concerns regarding Nexperia (安世半导体), a Chinese-owned semiconductor company facing operational restrictions in the Netherlands. The spokesperson announced that China granted export exemptions on November 1st for qualified exports in response to supply chain disruptions caused by Dutch government interference.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-01 (exemption announcement date)

**Scope:** Export exemptions for qualified exports related to semiconductor supply chain disruptions involving Nexperia

## Key Provisions

1. **Export Exemption Announcement:** On November 1st, China announced that "qualified exports" would be exempted ("中方于11月1日宣布将对符合条件的出口予以豁免").

2. **Policy Context:** The exemptions respond to supply chain disruptions caused by disputes between Chinese and Dutch entities regarding Nexperia operations.

3. **Diplomatic Position:** The statement emphasizes maintaining global semiconductor supply chain stability and calls on the Dutch government to cease interference in enterprise operations.

4. **Legal Nature:** This is a press statement providing policy guidance rather than a formal binding regulation with detailed technical specifications.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Medium to High Impact (speculative):** The export exemptions for semiconductor-related items suggest China is using export control policy as a lever in bilateral disputes with the Netherlands. Companies in the semiconductor supply chain should monitor whether these exemptions apply to their specific products and end-uses. The use of "qualified exports" (符合条件的出口) indicates that exemptions are conditional, likely requiring case-by-case approval or meeting specific criteria. Semiconductor firms with operations involving Chinese components or Dutch technology should prepare contingency plans for potential supply chain disruptions if the dispute escalates further.

## Notes

This statement is part of a broader context where China's SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation) had reportedly paused shipments to Nexperia due to Dutch government pressure. The export exemptions appear designed to provide relief while maintaining pressure on the Netherlands. Companies should seek clarification from MOFCOM on specific exemption criteria and application procedures.
