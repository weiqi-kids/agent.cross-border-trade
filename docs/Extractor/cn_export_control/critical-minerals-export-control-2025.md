## Summary

The Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement No. 10 of 2025, implementing immediate export controls on five strategic materials—tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium—effective February 4, 2025. The controls cover raw materials, processed products, compounds, and related production technologies based on national security and non-proliferation obligations.

## Key Provisions

### Controlled Items by Category

**1. Tungsten (钨):**
- Ammonium metatungstate, tungsten oxide, tungsten carbide
- Solid tungsten alloys (density ≥17.0 g/cm³, tensile strength ≥1270 MPa)
- Tungsten-nickel-iron alloys (≥90% tungsten)
- Tungsten-nickel-copper alloys (≥80% tungsten)
- Related production technology

**2. Tellurium (碲):**
- Metallic tellurium
- Tellurium compound crystals: cadmium telluride, cadmium zinc telluride, cadmium mercury telluride
- Production technology for tellurium-based crystals

**3. Bismuth (铋):**
- Non-controlled metallic bismuth and products
- Bismuth germanate (Bi₄Ge₃O₁₂)
- Triphenyl bismuth
- Related bismuth compounds and production technology

**4. Molybdenum (钼):**
- Molybdenum powder (≥97% purity, ≤50 μm particle size) for missile components
- Associated production technology

**5. Indium (铟):**
- Indium phosphide
- Trimethyl indium
- Triethyl indium
- Production technology

### Licensing Requirements

Exporters must obtain licenses from the State Council's commerce department per existing export control regulations before exporting controlled items.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** Very High

**Affected Industries:**
- Semiconductor manufacturing (indium compounds for III-V semiconductors)
- Infrared and thermal imaging (tellurium-based detector materials)
- Defense and aerospace (tungsten alloys, molybdenum for rocket components)
- Advanced optics (bismuth germanate for scintillators)
- Medical imaging (cadmium telluride for X-ray detectors)

**Geographic Considerations (speculative):**
- China dominates global production of tungsten (~80% market share), indium (~60%), and bismuth (~80%)
- Major importing countries—US, Japan, South Korea, and EU—face immediate supply chain risks
- Alternative suppliers (Vietnam for tungsten, Canada for indium, Mexico for bismuth) have limited capacity
- Technology controls on production processes create additional barriers to developing alternative supply sources

**Strategic Implications (speculative):**
- Timing suggests coordination with broader technology competition measures
- Controls on production technology inhibit foreign efforts to establish alternative supply chains
- High-purity specifications target advanced technology applications rather than commodity uses

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Exporters must establish license application procedures with provincial commerce departments
- Technical specification verification required to determine if products meet control thresholds
- End-user certification and supply chain documentation required for license applications
- Customs declaration accuracy critical for controlled item identification

## Notes

This announcement represents one of China's most significant critical mineral export control actions, targeting materials essential to advanced technology sectors. The inclusion of production technology controls is particularly noteworthy, as it extends beyond traditional commodity controls to limit foreign capacity to develop alternative supply chains. The immediate effective date (upon publication) suggests urgency and strategic timing considerations.
