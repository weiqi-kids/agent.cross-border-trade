## Summary

Canada announced export controls on quantum computing components, EUV lithography critical components, additive manufacturing equipment, and high-temperature coating technologies. The controls take effect 30 days after publication in the Canada Gazette, Part II.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Canadian government / Global Affairs Canada
- **Effective Date:** 30 days after publication in Canada Gazette, Part II (announced December 21, 2024)
- **Scope:** Quantum computing components (cryogenic cooling systems, parametric signal amplifiers, isotope-enriched silicon and germanium); EUV lithography critical components (masks and protective films); additive manufacturing equipment; high-temperature coating technologies for ceramic matrix composites (>1100°C)

## Key Provisions

1. **Quantum Computing Controls**: Export restrictions on low-temperature refrigeration systems (cryogenic cooling systems), parametric signal amplifiers, and isotope-enriched silicon and germanium used in quantum computing
2. **Semiconductor Manufacturing Controls**: Controls on critical components for EUV lithography-produced integrated circuits, specifically masks and protective films
3. **Additive Manufacturing Controls**: Export restrictions on additive manufacturing equipment
4. **High-Temperature Coating Controls**: Controls on coating development technologies designed to protect ceramic matrix composites from corrosion at temperatures exceeding 1100°C
5. **Implementation Timeline**: 30-day grace period after official gazette publication

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Semiconductor Sector**: Canadian suppliers of EUV lithography components (masks, protective films) will require export licenses, potentially delaying deliveries to non-allied markets
- **Quantum Technology**: Export restrictions on quantum computing components may fragment global quantum technology supply chains, particularly affecting research collaborations with countries outside Five Eyes/allied frameworks
- **Additive Manufacturing**: 3D printing equipment exports from Canada will face licensing requirements, potentially affecting aerospace, medical device, and defense-related manufacturing partnerships
- **Advanced Materials**: High-temperature coating technology controls (>1100°C) target aerospace and defense applications, likely impacting ceramic matrix composite supply chains for turbine engines and hypersonic systems
- **Alignment with Allies**: These controls appear coordinated with U.S. and EU semiconductor/emerging technology export restrictions, suggesting continued Western alignment on critical technology protection

## Notes

Article published on China MOFCOM export control website as international news compilation. Controls announced December 21, 2024, with effective date 30 days post-gazette publication (likely late January 2025). This represents Canada's alignment with multilateral emerging technology export control efforts, particularly in quantum computing and advanced semiconductor manufacturing.
