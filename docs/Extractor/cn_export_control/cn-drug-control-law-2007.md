## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Potential Impact**: Medium (Speculative)

**Affected Industries**:
- Pharmaceutical manufacturing and trade
- Chemical precursor suppliers
- International logistics providers handling controlled substances for legitimate medical/research purposes

**Trade Implications** (Speculative):
1. Companies exporting pharmaceutical products containing controlled substances must ensure compliance with both drug control and export control regulations
2. Precursor chemical exports may require dual licensing (drug control + export control)
3. Enhanced due diligence requirements for supply chain partners in pharmaceutical trade
4. Potential impact on cross-border e-commerce platforms preventing illegal drug trade

**Compliance Requirements** (Speculative):
- Licensing for legitimate trade in controlled pharmaceutical substances
- Record-keeping and reporting obligations for precursor chemicals
- End-user verification for exports of dual-use chemicals
- International cooperation protocols for cross-border enforcement

## Notes

- **Content Discrepancy**: This document is primarily a drug control law, not a traditional export control regulation. However, its presence on the Ministry of Commerce export control website suggests relevance to controlled substance trade.
- **Missing Export Control Details**: The WebFetch result did not provide detailed articles related to export licensing, trade controls, or specific precursor chemical lists. Full text review may be needed to identify export control provisions.
- **Date Discrepancy**: The law was passed in 2007 but appears on the website with a 2021-12-30 publication date, suggesting it may have been republished or updated.
- **Review Trigger**: Marked for review due to unclear connection to export control framework and potential need for detailed article-by-article analysis to identify trade-relevant provisions.
- **Language**: Original document title and key terms preserved in Chinese with English translations provided.
- **International Cooperation**: Chapter 5 on International Cooperation may contain relevant provisions for cross-border trade controls, but detailed content was not available in WebFetch results.
