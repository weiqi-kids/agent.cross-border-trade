## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*The following analysis is speculative and based on regulatory implications*

**Direct Impact**:
- Nuclear equipment manufacturers and suppliers must implement comprehensive compliance programs
- Export licensing timelines extend by minimum 15 working days for initial review
- Customs clearance procedures require additional documentation (IAEA certificates, recipient guarantees)

**Indirect Impact**:
- Dual-use technology suppliers may face enhanced scrutiny if equipment has potential nuclear applications
- Bonded warehouses and special customs zones handling nuclear-related items require similar compliance protocols
- Transshipment and transit operations subject to equivalent licensing requirements

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Companies engaged in peaceful nuclear cooperation must ensure recipient countries have IAEA safeguards agreements
- Technology transfer arrangements require specific provisions preventing military applications
- Supply chain visibility requirements extend to end-users and final disposition of controlled items

**Risk Factors**:
- Ambiguity in "related technical information" scope may create compliance uncertainty
- Multi-agency coordination requirements could create procedural delays
- Retransfer restrictions may limit flexibility in international nuclear supply chains
