- Licenses issued by the State Council foreign economic trade authority in conjunction with relevant departments

### 2. Operator Registration Requirements
- Exporters must register with the State Council foreign economic trade authority before engaging in export activities
- Registration prerequisite for license applications

- Recipients must provide end-user certificates guaranteeing:
  - Non-use for weapons of mass destruction (禁止用于大规模杀伤性武器)
  - Prohibition on unauthorized re-transfer to third parties (未经许可不得向第三方转让)

### 4. Application Documentation
- Required documents include:
  - Identity documentation of applicant and end-user
  - Export contracts
  - Technical specifications of items
  - End-user certificates
  - Guarantee letters

### 5. Processing Timelines

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: The following assessment is speculative and based on the regulatory framework described.**

### Potential Historical Impact (When Active)

1. **Life Sciences and Biotechnology Sector:**
   - Exporters of laboratory equipment, biological materials, fermentation systems, and related technologies faced mandatory licensing requirements
   - Increased compliance burden through registration, documentation, and end-user verification processes

2. **Processing Timeline Considerations:**
   - Two-tier system (15 vs. 45 business days) created differentiated compliance timelines based on sensitivity level
   - Potential supply chain delays for Category 2 items requiring extended review periods

3. **International Trade Relations:**
   - End-user guarantee requirements may have complicated exports to countries with less stringent tracking systems
   - Re-transfer prohibitions required downstream supply chain monitoring

4. **Compliance Costs:**
   - Registration requirements, documentation preparation, and legal review added operational costs for exporters
   - Penalty structure (up to 250,000 yuan plus confiscation) created strong incentive for compliance

### Current Relevance

Given the **repealed status** of this regulation, current export controls on biological dual-use items are governed by superseding legislation, most notably the Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国出口管制法, effective December 1, 2020). This historical regulation provides context for understanding the evolution of China's export control framework in the biotechnology sector.
