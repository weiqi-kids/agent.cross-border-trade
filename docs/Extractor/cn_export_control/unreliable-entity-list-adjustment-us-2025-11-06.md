## Summary
China adjusted unreliable entity list measures against US entities following China-US Kuala Lumpur consultations. From November 10, 2025, measures from the April 4 notice will be suspended for one additional year, while measures from the March 4 notice will be discontinued entirely. Domestic enterprises may apply for transactions with these entities.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Scope**: US entities on unreliable entity list per notices issued March 4 and April 4, 2025

## Key Provisions
- Measures implemented under Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and related regulations
- Previous notices issued March 4 and April 4, 2025, adding US entities to unreliable entity list
- Following China-US Kuala Lumpur trade consultations consensus:
  - **April 4 notice**: Suspension of measures continues for one additional year
  - **March 4 notice**: Measures discontinued entirely
- Domestic enterprises may apply for transactions with aforementioned entities
- Unreliable entity mechanism will conduct lawful review and approve qualifying applications

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Significant Relief**: The discontinuation of March 4 measures and extended suspension of April 4 measures substantially reduces restrictions on China-US commercial transactions. This opens pathways for Chinese companies to resume business with previously blacklisted US entities, subject to application approval. The policy signals China's willingness to reduce non-tariff barriers in exchange for reciprocal US actions, benefiting bilateral trade in technology, manufacturing, and services sectors.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This policy complements the simultaneous export control blacklist adjustments, forming a comprehensive package of China-US trade de-escalation measures.
