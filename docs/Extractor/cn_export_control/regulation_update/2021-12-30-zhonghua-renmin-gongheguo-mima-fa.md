## Summary

The Cryptography Law of the People's Republic of China, adopted on October 26, 2019, and effective from January 1, 2020, establishes a comprehensive legal framework for cryptography management in China, including classification systems (core, general, and commercial cryptography), import/export controls on commercial cryptography, and mandatory security assessments for critical information infrastructure. The law implements a tiered management approach distinguishing state secret protection from commercial applications, with significant implications for foreign investment and cross-border technology flows.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2020-01-01
- **Scope**: All cryptographic technologies, products, and services used in China; applies to domestic and foreign entities engaged in cryptography-related activities including research, production, sales, services, and import/export

## Key Provisions

### Classification System (Articles 6-8)

The law establishes three categories of cryptography:

1. **Core Cryptography (核心密码)**: Protects state secrets up to "Top Secret" classification
2. **General Cryptography (普通密码)**: Protects state secrets up to "Secret" classification
3. **Commercial Cryptography (商用密码)**: Protects information that does not constitute state secrets

Core and general cryptography are classified as state secrets and subject to strict unified management by cryptography authorities. Commercial cryptography may be legally used by citizens, legal persons, and other organizations to protect network and information security.

### Commercial Cryptography Management (Articles 21-31)

**Standards and Testing (Articles 22-26)**:
- National and industry standards system for commercial cryptography
- Voluntary testing and certification to enhance market competitiveness
- Mandatory testing/certification for commercial cryptography products listed as network critical equipment or cybersecurity-specific products (Article 26)
- Commercial cryptography services using network critical equipment must obtain certification

**Import/Export Controls (Article 28)**:
- Import licensing for commercial cryptography with encryption protection functions involving national security and public interest
- Export controls on commercial cryptography involving national security, public interest, or international obligations
- Import license lists and export control lists to be jointly formulated by Ministry of Commerce, State Cryptography Administration, and General Administration of Customs
- **Exemption**: Mass consumer products using commercial cryptography are exempt from import licensing and export controls

**Critical Information Infrastructure (Article 27)**:
- Operators of critical information infrastructure required by law to use commercial cryptography for protection must conduct security assessment of commercial cryptography applications
- Assessment to be coordinated with critical infrastructure security testing and cybersecurity level protection to avoid duplication
- Procurement of network products and services involving commercial cryptography that may affect national security requires national security review by Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) together with State Cryptography Administration

**E-Government (Article 29)**:
- State Cryptography Administration certifies institutions providing e-government electronic authentication services using commercial cryptography

**Supervision (Article 31)**:
- Daily supervision combined with random inspections
- Unified commercial cryptography supervision platform
- Authorities prohibited from requiring disclosure of source code or other proprietary cryptography information
- Strict confidentiality of business secrets and personal privacy

### Legal Liabilities (Articles 32-41)

**Administrative Penalties**:
- Unauthorized testing/certification agencies: Warnings, confiscation of illegal gains, fines of 100,000-300,000 RMB or 1-3 times illegal gains (Article 35)
- Sale of uncertified mandatory products/services: Warnings, confiscation of products/illegal gains, fines of 30,000-100,000 RMB or 1-3 times illegal gains (Article 36)
- Critical infrastructure operators failing to use required commercial cryptography or conduct assessments: Fines of 100,000-1,000,000 RMB on entities, 10,000-100,000 RMB on responsible individuals (Article 37)
- Unauthorized e-government authentication services: Warnings, confiscation, fines of 100,000-300,000 RMB or 1-3 times illegal gains (Article 39)

**Import/Export Violations (Article 38)**:
- Handled by Ministry of Commerce or Customs in accordance with law

**Criminal Liability (Article 41)**:
- Violations constituting crimes subject to criminal prosecution

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[Interpretive Analysis - Not Legal Advice]**

**Import/Export Compliance Burden**:
- Foreign entities exporting cryptography products or services to China must determine whether items fall under import licensing requirements (Article 28)
- Exemption for mass consumer products provides relief for B2C technology but leaves ambiguity for B2B commercial cryptography solutions
- Dual licensing authority (Ministry of Commerce + State Cryptography Administration) creates potential for inconsistent application

**Critical Infrastructure Operators**:
- Foreign-invested enterprises operating critical information infrastructure in China face mandatory commercial cryptography usage and assessment requirements (Article 27)
- Procurement of foreign cryptography products/services may trigger national security review, creating uncertainty and potential delays
- Assessment coordination with existing cybersecurity frameworks may reduce duplication but adds complexity

**Technology Transfer Concerns**:
- Article 21's prohibition on "using administrative means to force transfer of commercial cryptography technology" provides formal protection for foreign investors
- However, testing, certification, and security assessment processes may practically require disclosure of technical details despite Article 31's prohibition on source code disclosure requirements
- Lack of clear procedural safeguards for protecting proprietary information during assessments

**Standards and Interoperability**:
- Mandatory compliance with Chinese commercial cryptography standards (Article 24) may require foreign entities to develop China-specific implementations
- Encouragement of international standardization participation (Article 23) suggests potential for harmonization but does not eliminate compliance costs

**Enforcement Risk**:
- Significant administrative penalties and criminal liability create compliance risk for foreign entities
- Broad discretion in enforcement (e.g., "involving national security" triggers in Articles 27-28) introduces unpredictability

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Law formalizes China's cryptography sovereignty approach, treating cryptography as both industrial policy and national security instrument
- Foreign entities in sectors involving critical infrastructure, government services, or dual-use technologies face heightened scrutiny
- Supply chain partners of affected entities should assess indirect compliance exposure
