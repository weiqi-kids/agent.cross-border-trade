## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High Strategic Significance for Export Control Framework:**

This law provides the foundational legal basis for China's national security review system, which directly impacts cross-border trade and investment. Key implications for supply chains:

1. **Broad Security Review Authority** (Article 59): Establishes legal framework for reviewing foreign investments, technology transfers, and critical infrastructure projects, which has been operationalized through subsequent laws like the Export Control Law (2020) and Foreign Investment Security Review Measures

2. **Technology and Data Security**: Articles 24-25 emphasize indigenous technology development and cybersecurity, potentially affecting:
   - Foreign technology providers' market access
   - Data localization requirements
   - Technology transfer conditions in joint ventures

3. **Dual-Use Item Controls**: The law's emphasis on military-civilian integration (Article 18) and strategic resource control (Article 21) provides legal basis for dual-use export controls

4. **Extraterritorial Implications**: Article 33's protection of overseas Chinese interests and assets could be invoked to justify extraterritorial application of Chinese laws

5. **Compliance Requirements**: Enterprises operating in or trading with China should:
   - Conduct national security self-assessments for sensitive sectors
   - Prepare for potential security reviews in M&A transactions
   - Monitor implementing regulations for specific sector requirements
   - Establish data security and technology protection protocols

**Note**: This assessment is interpretive and does not constitute legal advice. Specific impact depends on implementing regulations and enforcement practices.
