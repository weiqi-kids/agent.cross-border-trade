## Summary

The Regulation on Control of Precursor Chemicals establishes a comprehensive licensing and classification system for chemicals that can be used in illicit drug production. Originally issued in 2005 (State Council Order No. 445) and amended three times (2014, 2016, 2018), it controls production, operations, purchasing, transportation, and import/export of precursor chemicals through strict documentation and inter-agency oversight.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国国务院)
- **Effective Date**: Original: 2005-11-01; Amendments: 2014, 2016, 2018
- **Scope**: All entities and individuals engaged in production, operation, purchase, transportation, import, or export of precursor chemicals in China

## Key Provisions

### Classification System

Three-tier classification based on role in illicit drug production:
- **Category I**: Primary precursors directly used in drug manufacturing
- **Category II & III**: Chemical additives and secondary precursors

### Regulatory Requirements by Activity

**1. Production and Operations**
- Enterprise legal representatives and technical/management personnel must possess knowledge of safety production and precursor chemicals (企业法定代表人和技术、管理人员具有安全生产和易制毒化学品的有关知识)
- Licensing requirements vary by category
- Regular reporting obligations to authorities

**2. Purchasing Controls**
- Individual purchases of Category I and II chemicals are strictly prohibited
- Medical institutions with proper licensing granted exemptions for legitimate medical use
- Documentation and verification requirements for all transactions

**3. Transportation**
- Authorization requirements differ based on:
  - Chemical category
  - Transportation distance
  - Mode of transport

**4. Import and Export**
- Mandatory approval from commerce departments (商务部门)
- International verification procedures apply for cross-border transactions
- Pre-export notification requirements for certain chemicals under multilateral control regimes

**5. Oversight and Enforcement**
- Multiple government agencies share enforcement responsibilities:
  - Public Security (公安部门): Overall supervision
  - Commerce (商务部门): Import/export approval
  - Production Safety (安全生产监督管理部门): Production safety oversight
- Mandatory inter-agency information sharing and coordination

### Penalties

Violations subject to:
- Confiscation of illegal products and proceeds
- Fines ranging from 10,000 to 500,000 yuan based on violation severity
- Business license revocation for serious violations
- Criminal prosecution for severe cases involving drug production facilitation

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High-Risk Industries**: Chemical manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and international traders handling precursor chemicals face stringent compliance requirements that may increase operational costs and lead times.

**Import/Export Implications**: Cross-border shipments of precursor chemicals require pre-approval from Chinese commerce departments, potentially causing delays of 15-30 days for license processing. International buyers should factor this into procurement planning.

**Due Diligence Requirements**: Suppliers must verify customer credentials and maintain detailed transaction records, increasing administrative burden but reducing diversion risk.

**Multilateral Alignment**: China's precursor chemical controls align with international frameworks (INCB, UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic), facilitating legitimate trade while preventing diversion.
