## Export Control Relevance

This law provides the legal foundation for China's export control licensing regime. Key implications include:

1. **Procedural Requirements**: Export control licenses must follow the 20-day decision timeline (Article 42), unless specific export control laws provide otherwise
2. **Transparency Obligations**: Export control licensing requirements and procedures must be publicly disclosed (Article 5)
3. **Appeal Rights**: Export license applicants have rights to administrative review and litigation if licenses are improperly denied (Article 7)
4. **Technical Review Standards**: Inspections and technical reviews for controlled items must follow published standards (Article 55)
5. **Legal Basis**: Export control authorities can only impose licensing requirements authorized by law or administrative regulations (Article 14)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

While this law does not directly change export control requirements, it establishes important procedural protections and timelines that affect how export licenses are processed:

- **Timeline Predictability**: The 20-day processing requirement (with 10-day extension) provides some predictability for exporters planning shipments, though export control laws may override this timeline
- **Due Process Rights**: Companies denied export licenses have clear legal grounds to challenge decisions through administrative review
- **Transparency**: The requirement to publicly disclose licensing requirements helps exporters understand compliance obligations
- **Risk of Inconsistent Application**: Local variations in implementation may create compliance challenges for companies operating across multiple Chinese jurisdictions
