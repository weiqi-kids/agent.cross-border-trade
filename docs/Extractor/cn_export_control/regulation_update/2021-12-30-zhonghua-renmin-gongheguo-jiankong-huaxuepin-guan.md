## Summary

This regulation establishes the administrative framework for monitored chemicals in China, dividing them into four categories based on their potential use in chemical weapons production. The regulation was originally promulgated on December 27, 1995, and revised on January 8, 2011, implementing strict controls on production, storage, use, and import/export of chemicals that could be used to produce chemical weapons, with the most stringent controls applied to Category I chemicals.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国国务院)
- **Effective Date**: 1995-12-27 (original); 2011-01-08 (revision)
- **Scope**: All entities engaged in production, trading, or use of monitored chemicals within the territory of the People's Republic of China

## Key Provisions

### Classification System (Article 3)

The regulation establishes four categories of monitored chemicals:

1. **Category I**: Chemicals that can be used as chemical weapons
2. **Category II**: Chemicals that can be used as precursors for producing chemical weapons
3. **Category III**: Chemicals that can be used as primary raw materials for producing chemical weapons
4. **Category IV**: Specific organic chemicals (excluding explosives and pure hydrocarbons)

The specific list of monitored chemicals in each category is proposed by the State Council's chemical industry competent department and published after approval by the State Council.

### Production Controls

**Category I (Articles 6)**: Strictly controlled; production only permitted for scientific research, medical, pharmaceutical manufacturing, or protective purposes. Must be produced in small-scale facilities designated by the State Council's chemical industry competent department. Production at non-designated facilities is strictly prohibited.

**Categories II, III, and phosphorus/sulfur/fluorine-containing Category IV chemicals (Article 7)**: Subject to special permit system; no unit or individual may produce without special permit.

**Construction of production facilities (Article 8)**: New construction, expansion, or modification of facilities must obtain approval from the State Council's chemical industry competent department through provincial authorities. Facilities can only begin production after acceptance inspection and approval.

### Storage Requirements (Articles 9-11)

- Must be stored in specialized chemical warehouses with dedicated management personnel
- Storage conditions must comply with national regulations
- Strict entry/exit inspection and registration systems required
- Loss or theft must be reported immediately to local public security and chemical industry authorities
- Deteriorated or expired chemicals must be disposed of according to approved plans

### Use Controls (Articles 12-13, 19-20)

- **Category I use**: Requires approval from State Council's chemical industry competent department; contract with designated production units required
- **Category II use**: Requires provincial-level approval; contract with designated sales units required
- Use must be consistent with declared purposes; changes require approval from original approving authority
- Regular reporting of consumption quantities and final product quantities required

### Import/Export Controls (Articles 14-18)

- Only designated units appointed by State Council authorities may conduct import/export business for Categories I, II, III chemicals and their production technology/specialized equipment
- **Category I imports**: Strictly controlled; only permitted for scientific research, medical, pharmaceutical manufacturing, or protective purposes. Requires State Council approval.
- **Category I exports**: Requires guarantee letter from importing country government certifying chemicals will only be used for permitted purposes and not re-exported
- **Categories II, III imports/exports**: Require approval from State Council's chemical industry competent department and guarantee letters from importing country

### Penalties (Articles 21-25)

- Violations in production: Up to 200,000 yuan fine; serious cases may result in production suspension
- Violations in use: Up to 50,000 yuan fine
- Violations in trading: Confiscation of chemicals and illegal gains; fines up to 2x the illegal trading amount
- Concealment or refusal to report data: Up to 50,000 yuan fine
- Violations constituting crimes: Criminal liability pursued according to law

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Compliance Requirements**: Companies involved in production, import, export, or use of chemicals classified in any of the four categories must ensure proper registration, permitting, and reporting procedures. This creates significant compliance overhead for chemical manufacturers and traders.

**Trade Restrictions**: The designated unit system for import/export effectively creates a state-controlled monopoly on cross-border trade of these chemicals, potentially limiting supply chain flexibility and increasing transaction costs for legitimate users.

**Production Constraints**: The prohibition on Category I production outside designated facilities and the special permit requirements for Categories II-IV limit production capacity and may create supply bottlenecks for industries requiring these chemicals for legitimate purposes (pharmaceuticals, research, etc.).

**International Cooperation Impact**: The requirement for guarantee letters from importing country governments for exports suggests China's alignment with international chemical weapons control regimes (likely Chemical Weapons Convention), which may facilitate legitimate international trade but requires coordination with foreign government authorities.

**Risk Mitigation**: Companies in sectors using any monitored chemicals should implement robust internal controls, maintain detailed records, and establish relationships with designated import/export units to ensure compliance and supply continuity.

- Content obtained via curl fallback (WebFetch not used)
- This regulation implements China's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention
- The regulation applies to the chemical industry competent departments at State Council level and provincial/autonomous region/municipality levels
- Entities already engaged in monitored chemical activities before regulation implementation must complete required procedures according to regulation requirements (Article 26)
- This is a fundamental regulation in China's export control system for dual-use chemicals
