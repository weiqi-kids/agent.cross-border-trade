## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Direct Impact on Export Control Enforcement:**
This law provides the foundational legal framework for MOFCOM and other Chinese agencies to impose penalties for export control violations. Companies subject to Chinese export control regulations should note:

1. **Procedural Rights**: Enhanced protections include rights to statement, defense, and hearing for major penalties, allowing companies to challenge export control penalty decisions through administrative review or litigation.

2. **Penalty Standards**: The proportionality principle (Article 5) requires penalties to match the severity of violations, potentially moderating penalties for first-time or minor export control violations under Article 33.

3. **Statute of Limitations**: The 5-year extended limitation period (Article 36) applies to export control violations with national security implications, maintaining enforcement authority for historical violations.

4. **Enforcement Coordination**: Article 27's case transfer mechanism between administrative and judicial authorities strengthens coordination in serious export control violations potentially involving criminal liability.

5. **Compliance Value**: Understanding these procedural requirements helps companies prepare effective responses to export control investigations and penalty proceedings, potentially reducing penalty severity through prompt cooperation and corrective action (Article 32).
