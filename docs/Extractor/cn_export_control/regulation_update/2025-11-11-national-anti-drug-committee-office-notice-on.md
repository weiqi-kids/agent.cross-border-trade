## Summary

The National Anti-Drug Committee Office issued a 13-point notice on November 10, 2025, addressing the management and control of drug precursors and non-listed precursor chemicals and equipment. While the notice primarily focuses on domestic drug control, it references the Export Control Law and includes provisions for international export compliance, particularly regarding exports to high-risk countries such as the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: National Anti-Drug Committee Office (国家禁毒委员会办公室)
- **Effective Date**: Not specified (immediate notification)
- **Scope**: Enterprises and individuals involved in production, sale, transportation, and import/export of drug precursor chemicals and related equipment; postal, logistics, and freight forwarding companies

## Key Provisions

1. **Criminal Prohibitions**: Prohibits illegal production, trading, and transportation of controlled precursors including acetic anhydride, ether, and chloroform
2. **Criminal Complicity**: Those knowingly providing non-listed precursor chemicals for illegal drug manufacturing are subject to prosecution as accomplices
3. **Tax Compliance**: Enterprises must fulfill tax obligations; tax evasion carries administrative and criminal penalties
4. **Customs Violations**: Smuggling of these materials violates customs law and may result in confiscation and criminal charges
5. **Online Advertising Restrictions**:
   - Enterprises must possess proper licenses to advertise non-pharmaceutical precursors online
   - Individuals are completely prohibited from posting such advertisements
   - Prohibits advertising of pharmaceutical precursors on internet platforms
6. **International Export Compliance**:
   - Exporters must monitor foreign laws, especially in high-risk countries (US, Canada, Mexico)
   - Should require foreign customers to comply with their domestic import procedures
   - Risk of foreign law enforcement prosecution if exporting controlled items without proper authorization
7. **Internal Controls**: Encourages enterprises to establish internal management systems, maintain records, verify foreign buyer credentials, and be alert to suspicious transactions
8. **Reporting Obligations**: Postal, logistics, and freight forwarding companies must report suspicious shipments to public security or customs authorities
9. **Anti-Money Laundering**: Enterprises and individuals must comply with anti-money laundering and foreign exchange management regulations
10. **Network Operator Responsibilities**: Online platforms must monitor and remove prohibited content
11. **Legal Basis**: References multiple laws including Export Control Law (出口管制法), Criminal Law, Anti-Drug Law, Customs Law, and others

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: This is speculative analysis based on available information**

- **Limited Direct Impact on Traditional Export Control Items**: This notice primarily targets drug precursor chemicals rather than dual-use items, military goods, or nuclear materials typically covered under export control regimes
- **Potential Indirect Impact**:
  - Chemical exporters may face increased scrutiny and compliance requirements
  - Companies exporting chemicals with dual-use potential (legitimate industrial use + potential drug manufacturing use) need enhanced due diligence
  - Risk of foreign prosecution creates compliance burden for Chinese exporters to North America
- **Compliance Costs**: Enterprises in chemical sectors may need to invest in enhanced internal controls, customer verification systems, and legal compliance programs
- **Cross-Border Trade Friction**: Heightened focus on precursor exports to US, Canada, and Mexico may lead to increased inspections and delays

## Notes

- **Content Retrieved**: via curl fallback (WebFetch not used)
- **Review Reason**: This article is tangential to the core scope of cn_export_control Layer. While it references the Export Control Law (出口管制法) in its legal basis and includes export-related provisions, the primary focus is on drug precursor control under anti-narcotics law rather than export control of dual-use items, military goods, or strategic materials. The article appeared on the export control website but is functionally a drug control notice.
- **Relevance Assessment**: Marginal relevance to export control regime. The notice addresses chemical export compliance but from a narcotics control perspective rather than strategic export control. Consider whether such articles should be systematically excluded from this Layer.
- **Translation Note**: "易制毒化学品" translated as "drug precursor chemicals" or "precursor chemicals used in drug manufacturing"
- **Disclaimer**: This policy interpretation is for reference only and does not constitute legal advice. Enterprises should consult qualified legal counsel for compliance guidance.
