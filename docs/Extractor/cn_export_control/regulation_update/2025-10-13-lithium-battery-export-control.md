## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs announced new export controls on lithium battery technologies, positive electrode materials, and graphite anode materials, effective November 8, 2025. The regulation covers high-energy-density rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (≥300 Wh/kg), manufacturing equipment, and related production technologies, requiring export licenses from MOFCOM.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and General Administration of Customs (GACC)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Scope**: Lithium battery manufacturing equipment, high-density electrode materials, and related production technologies

## Key Provisions

### Controlled Items:

**1. Lithium Battery Items:**
- Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with weight energy density ≥300 Wh/kg (including cells and battery packs)
- Battery manufacturing equipment: winding machines, stacking machines, electrolyte injection machines, heat press machines, formation and grading systems, grading cabinets
- Technologies for manufacturing controlled items

**2. Positive Electrode Material Items:**
- Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode materials with compaction density ≥2.5 g/cm³ and specific capacity ≥156 mAh/g
- Ternary cathode material precursors
- Lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials
- Related production equipment and technologies

**3. Graphite Anode Material Items:**
- Artificial graphite anode materials
- Mixed anode materials
- Production equipment for granulation, graphitization, coating modification, and process technologies

### Compliance Requirements:

- Exporters must apply for permits from MOFCOM
- Export declaration forms must accurately indicate item attributes and dual-use item export control codes

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

> **Note**: This is a speculative assessment and should be reviewed by a human expert.

This regulation will significantly impact global electric vehicle and energy storage supply chains. Key impacts include:

1. **Battery Manufacturers**: Companies exporting high-density lithium batteries or production lines to China may face export license requirements, potentially delaying deliveries and increasing compliance costs.

2. **Equipment Suppliers**: Manufacturers of specialized battery production equipment (winding, stacking, formation systems) will need to obtain export licenses, potentially affecting equipment sales and technology transfer agreements.

3. **Material Producers**: Suppliers of advanced cathode materials (especially high-density LFP and lithium-rich manganese materials) and graphite anode materials may face scrutiny when exporting to destinations that could re-export to sensitive end-users.

4. **Technology Transfer**: Joint ventures and technology licensing agreements involving controlled production technologies will require additional government approvals, potentially slowing international collaborations.

5. **Competitive Positioning**: This control may strengthen China's domestic battery supply chain while restricting advanced technology outflow, potentially affecting global competitiveness in the EV and energy storage sectors.
