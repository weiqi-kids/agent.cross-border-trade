## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This fundamental law provides the legal foundation for China's entire export control regime. Key supply chain implications:

1. **Export Control Legal Basis**: Articles 15-18 establish the legal framework for China's export control lists, licensing systems, and enforcement mechanisms that directly impact global technology and dual-use goods supply chains.

2. **State Trading Requirements**: Article 10's state trading provisions affect critical commodities where only authorized enterprises can conduct import/export, creating supply chain concentration risks.

3. **National Security Provisions**: Article 16's broad authority over nuclear materials and military goods, plus wartime powers, creates potential for rapid supply disruptions during geopolitical tensions.

4. **Trade Remedy Tools**: The comprehensive trade remedy chapter (VII-VIII) provides China with legal tools to impose anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures that can restrict market access and alter competitive dynamics.

5. **Reciprocity Mechanisms**: Article 7 and Article 30 authorize retaliatory measures against discriminatory treatment, which could escalate trade tensions and fragment supply chains.

6. **Compliance Requirements**: The law's compliance obligations, including automatic licensing (Article 14), origin management (Article 21), and certification requirements (Article 20), impose administrative burdens on exporters/importers.

**Assessment**: As the overarching legal framework, this law enables China's regulatory agencies (especially MOFCOM) to implement specific export control measures, trade restrictions, and enforcement actions. Companies engaged in China trade should monitor implementing regulations and agency announcements that operationalize these broad statutory provisions.
