## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**NOTE: The following is speculative analysis based on the legal framework**

This foundational customs law has significant implications for cross-border supply chains:

1. **Export Control Enforcement**: Article 6 grants customs extensive inspection and detention powers, providing the legal basis for enforcing export control regulations at border checkpoints. Companies exporting dual-use items or controlled goods must ensure proper licensing before customs clearance.

2. **Processing Trade Compliance**: Articles 32-33 impose strict supervision on bonded processing operations. Manufacturers using imported components for re-export must maintain accurate records and undergo periodic customs audits, impacting just-in-time supply chain operations.

3. **Tariff Classification Risk**: Articles 41-43 give customs final authority on commodity classification and origin determination. Misclassification can trigger retroactive duty assessments (Article 62: up to 3 years for non-compliance), creating financial exposure for importers.

4. **Detention and Cash Flow Impact**: Article 60 allows customs to freeze bank accounts and seize goods for unpaid duties after 3 months. This creates working capital risks for companies with disputed tariff assessments.

5. **Intellectual Property Enforcement**: Article 44 empowers customs to detain suspected counterfeit goods, potentially disrupting legitimate supply chains if trademark/patent rights are unclear or disputed.

6. **Anti-Smuggling Coordination**: Articles 4-5 establish joint enforcement between customs police and local authorities, increasing inspection frequency and compliance scrutiny at all border points.
