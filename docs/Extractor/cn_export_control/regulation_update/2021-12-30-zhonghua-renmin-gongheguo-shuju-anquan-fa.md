## Summary

The PRC Data Security Law, effective September 1, 2021, establishes a comprehensive legal framework for data security governance, classification, cross-border transfer controls, and penalties. It introduces a data classification system with export controls on sensitive data and mandates strict compliance obligations for data handlers, particularly regarding cross-border data flows.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-09-01
- **Scope**: All organizations and individuals conducting data processing activities within PRC territory; extraterritorial jurisdiction applies to activities harming PRC national security or public interest

## Key Provisions

### Data Classification and Export Controls (Chapter III, Articles 21-26)
- **National Data Classification System**: Establishes tiered protection based on importance to economic/social development, national security, and public interest
- **Export Control Regime**: Article 25 explicitly subjects controlled data items to export control laws and regulations
- **Risk Assessment**: Mandatory assessment for important data processors, including annual reviews and emergency response mechanisms
- **Cross-Border Transfer Review**: Data affecting national security or public interest requires security assessment before transfer abroad

### Compliance Obligations for Data Handlers (Chapter IV, Articles 27-36)
- **Security Measures**: Encryption, backup, access control, and personnel management requirements
- **Incident Reporting**: Immediate notification to competent authorities upon data security incidents
- **Personnel Training**: Regular security education and background checks for key positions
- **Public Procurement**: Preference for secure and controllable products/services in government systems

### Penalties and Enforcement (Chapter VI, Articles 44-52)
- **Administrative Fines**:
  - Data handlers violating security obligations: RMB 20,000 to 2,000,000
  - Illegal cross-border transfer: RMB 50,000 to 5,000,000, potential business suspension
  - Violations by state agencies: sanctions against responsible officials
- **Criminal Liability**: Serious violations may trigger criminal prosecution
- **Credit System**: Violations recorded in social credit records

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact on Cross-Border Data Transfers**: Companies exporting data from China must navigate security assessments, potentially causing delays in:
- Cloud service providers transferring customer data internationally
- Multinational corporations consolidating employee/operational data to overseas HQs
- Research collaborations requiring data sharing across borders

**Export Control Overlap**: Article 25's reference to export control laws creates dual compliance requirements for entities handling both physical controlled items (traditional export control) and controlled data categories, particularly in sectors like:
- Semiconductor/advanced manufacturing (technical data)
- Biotechnology (genetic/health data)
- Critical infrastructure (operational/security data)

**Compliance Costs**: Enterprises must implement:
- Data classification systems aligned with national standards
- Technical security measures (encryption, access logs, audit trails)
- Legal/compliance teams to interpret overlapping regulations (Data Security Law, Cybersecurity Law, Export Control Law, Personal Information Protection Law)

**Supply Chain Visibility Constraints**: Restrictions on cross-border data flows may limit:
- Real-time supply chain tracking systems relying on data aggregation
- Third-party logistics providers' visibility into Chinese operations
- Quality control audits requiring transfer of production data
