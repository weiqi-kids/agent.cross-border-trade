## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce issued Announcement No. 61 on October 9, 2025, establishing comprehensive export control measures for rare earth materials and related items targeting foreign organizations and individuals. The regulation extends China's export control jurisdiction extraterritorially to cover items containing Chinese-origin rare earth materials manufactured abroad, products made using Chinese rare earth technology, and original Chinese rare earth products. The measures include strict licensing requirements, presumptive denial for military end-users and listed entities, and immediate implementation with partial provisions taking effect December 1, 2025.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM)
- **Effective Date**: Immediate for Section 1(3); December 1, 2025 for Sections 1(1) and 1(2)
- **Scope**: Foreign organizations and individuals exporting rare earth items to countries/regions outside China; covers three categories of controlled items with extraterritorial reach

## Key Provisions

### 1. Controlled Items Requiring Export License (Article 1)

Foreign organizations and individuals ("Foreign Specific Export Operators") must obtain dual-use item export licenses from MOFCOM before exporting the following to countries/regions outside China:

**(1) Items Containing Chinese-Origin Rare Earth Materials (>0.1% value ratio)**
- Items manufactured abroad using Attachment 1 Part 1 listed Chinese-origin rare earth materials
- Items integrated with or mixed with such materials
- Threshold: Chinese rare earth materials constitute ≥0.1% of the value of the manufactured item

**(2) Items Produced Using Chinese Rare Earth Technology**
- Items produced abroad using Chinese rare earth extraction, smelting and separation, metal refining, magnetic material manufacturing, or rare earth secondary resource recycling technologies
- Covers all items listed in Attachment 1

**(3) Chinese-Origin Rare Earth Items**
- All items in Attachment 1 that originate from China

### 2. Presumptive Denial Cases (Articles 2-3)

Export applications will be **denied in principle** for:

- **Article 2**: Exports to foreign military end-users, and entities listed on export control watch lists and concern lists (including subsidiaries/branches with ≥50% ownership)

- **Article 3**: End-uses involving:
  - Design, development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems
  - Terrorist purposes
  - Military use or enhancement of military capabilities

### 3. Case-by-Case Review (Article 4)

Export applications subject to individual assessment:
- End-use for R&D or production of **14-nanometer or below logic chips** or **256-layer or above memory chips**
- Manufacturing equipment, testing equipment, and materials for such semiconductor processes
- R&D of **artificial intelligence with potential military applications**

### 4. Humanitarian Exception (Article 5)

No export license required for end-uses involving:
- Emergency medical response
- Public health emergencies
- Natural disaster relief
- Other humanitarian assistance

**Post-export reporting required**: Within 10 working days via email to jingwaibaogao@mofcom.gov.cn, with commitment that items will not be used to harm China's national security and interests.

### 5. Application Process (Article 6)

- **System**: http://ecomp.mofcom.gov.cn
- **Language**: All documents must be in Chinese
- **Requirements**: Per Article 16 of the PRC Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- **Application Methods**:
  - Direct submission by foreign operators
  - Delegation to Chinese enterprises, intermediary service organizations, chambers of commerce, or associations (must be independent legal entities)
- **Advisory Email**: jingwaizixun@mofcom.gov.cn (for uncertain items)

### 6. Compliance Notification Obligations (Article 7)

**Domestic Exporters**:
- Must report final destination country/region at export customs declaration
- Must issue "Compliance Notice" to foreign importers and end-users per the compliance guidance

**Foreign Exporters**:
- Must issue "Compliance Notice" to next recipient when transferring or exporting controlled items
- Per compliance guidance requirements

### 7. Implementation Timeline (Article 8)

- **Section 1(1) and 1(2)**: Effective December 1, 2025
- **Section 1(3)**: Effective immediately upon publication (October 9, 2025)

### 8. Attachments

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[ANALYSIS - Speculative Assessment]**

This regulation represents a significant expansion of China's export control jurisdiction with potentially far-reaching implications for global rare earth supply chains:

### Immediate Impact Areas

1. **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: The 14nm/256-layer threshold directly targets advanced chip production facilities globally, creating uncertainty for fabs using any Chinese rare earth materials or processing technologies in their supply chains.

2. **Defense and Aerospace**: Presumptive denial for military end-users and military-capable AI development will force defense contractors to audit their rare earth supply chains and seek alternative sources.

3. **Electronics Manufacturing**: The 0.1% value threshold is extremely low - many consumer electronics, EVs, and renewable energy products could inadvertently trigger licensing requirements if they contain Chinese rare earth magnets, phosphors, or catalysts.

4. **Extraterritorial Reach**: By controlling items "manufactured abroad using Chinese technology," China extends its jurisdiction beyond direct exports. Companies using Chinese rare earth processing know-how (even outside China) may face compliance obligations.

### Compliance Challenges

- **Traceability Burden**: Manufacturers must now track rare earth material origin and value ratios throughout complex supply chains
- **Technology Transfer Audits**: Companies must determine if their rare earth processing methods derive from Chinese technology sources
- **Cascading Notifications**: The "Compliance Notice" requirement creates a documentation chain across multiple jurisdictions

### Strategic Considerations

- **Market Concentration Risk**: China controls ~70% of global rare earth mining and >90% of processing capacity, limiting alternatives for affected industries
- **Timing Significance**: December 1 implementation for foreign-manufactured items suggests a deliberate grace period for supply chain adjustments
- **Coordination with Other Measures**: This may be coordinated with China's broader technology export control regime and critical mineral security policies

### Sectors Requiring Urgent Review

- Automotive (EV motors, catalytic converters)
- Renewable energy (wind turbine generators)
- Consumer electronics (smartphone components, displays)
- Medical devices (MRI machines, X-ray equipment)
- Telecommunications equipment
- Advanced manufacturing equipment
