## Summary

China's State Council issued a comprehensive update to the Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulation (Decree No. 792) on September 30, 2024, effective December 1, 2024. This regulation strengthens export controls on goods, technologies, and services with both civilian and military applications, establishing detailed licensing procedures, end-user management systems, and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security and fulfill non-proliferation obligations.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2024-12-01
- **Scope**: All dual-use items (goods, technologies, services with civilian purposes but military applications or WMD development potential)

## Key Provisions

### Control Framework
- **Three-tier licensing system**: Single permits (one-time exports), general permits (multiple exports for qualified exporters), and registration-based export certificates (simplified procedures)
- **Control lists**: Formally established dual-use items export control lists through consultation with industry
- **Temporary controls**: Up to 2 years (renewable once) for items requiring urgent control before permanent listing

### Licensing Requirements
- Standard applications processed within 45 working days
- General permits require demonstrated compliance systems
- Previous criminal convictions, serious violations, or connections to sanctioned entities disqualify applicants from streamlined permits
- Exporters must report actual shipment status and comply with all license terms

### End-User Management
- Mandatory end-user certificates with government verification for high-risk items
- Risk management systems to evaluate end-users and intended purposes
- Monitoring lists for uncooperative importers/end-users requiring enhanced scrutiny
- 5-year documentation retention requirement
- Exporters must immediately halt shipments upon discovering unauthorized end-use changes

### Entity Control Lists
- Trading prohibitions or restrictions for entities violating end-user requirements, endangering security, or facilitating terrorism
- Listed entities may request removal upon demonstrating compliance

### Enforcement
- Customs clearance requires license presentation
- Customs may challenge suspicious exports and request commerce department evaluation
- Professional classification determinations for disputed items
- Citizens must report foreign government inspection requests before responding

### Penalties
- Unlicensed exports: Warnings to multi-million yuan fines and business suspension
- Violations by service providers facilitating illegal exports face similar penalties
- Serious violations trigger criminal prosecution
- Experts violating professional standards face credential revocation

### Extraterritorial Application
- Foreign entities manufacturing items incorporating Chinese-origin controlled materials face similar controls
- Transit, transshipment, re-export, and special customs zone operations follow export control rules

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

> **Note**: This is a speculative assessment and should be reviewed by a human expert.

### Immediate Compliance Burden
Companies exporting dual-use items from China will face significantly increased compliance requirements, including:
- Implementation of internal compliance systems to qualify for general permits
- Enhanced due diligence on end-users and end-use purposes
- 5-year record retention systems
- Real-time shipment tracking and reporting capabilities

### Extraterritorial Reach
The regulation's extraterritorial provisions (Article 49) create new obligations for foreign manufacturers using Chinese-origin controlled materials, potentially affecting:
- Semiconductor manufacturing (Chinese rare earth materials, processing equipment components)
- Advanced materials supply chains (graphite, tungsten, gallium compounds)
- Technology products incorporating Chinese-controlled components

### License Processing Timelines
The 45-working-day standard processing time (approximately 9 weeks) will extend supply chain lead times, particularly impacting:
- Just-in-time manufacturing models
- Time-sensitive technology transfers
- Project-based exports with fixed delivery schedules

### Strategic Trade Controls Alignment
This regulation supersedes four previous regulations (dual-use, missile, biological, and chemical equipment controls), creating a unified framework that aligns China's controls more closely with international regimes (Wassenaar, MTCR, AG, NSG), potentially:
- Facilitating legitimate trade through clearer rules
- Increasing scrutiny on sensitive technology transfers
- Requiring re-evaluation of existing supply agreements

### High-Risk Sectors
Enhanced controls likely impact:
- Semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials
- Advanced computing and telecommunications
- Aerospace and aviation components
- Biotechnology and life sciences
- Advanced manufacturing systems (CNC, additive manufacturing)
- Emerging technologies (AI chips, quantum computing, advanced robotics)

### Monitoring List Implications
The new monitoring list mechanism (Article 26) creates reputational and operational risks for importers flagged for non-cooperation, potentially leading to:
- Longer license review times for subsequent transactions
- Enhanced end-user verification requirements
- Supply chain partner selection pressures

## Notes

WebFetch successful. Full regulation text obtained from official government source. This is a major regulatory update consolidating and modernizing China's dual-use export control framework. The regulation explicitly supersedes four previous regulations (State Council Decree No. 752, No. 593, No. 571, and No. 511), effective December 1, 2024.
