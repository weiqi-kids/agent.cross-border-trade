## Summary

The Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China, enacted on June 10, 2021 by the 13th National People's Congress Standing Committee, establishes a legal framework for China to impose countermeasures against foreign entities and individuals that implement discriminatory restrictive measures against Chinese citizens and organizations. The law empowers relevant State Council departments to maintain a countermeasures list and enforce restrictions including visa denials, asset freezes, and transaction prohibitions.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (全国人民代表大会常务委员会)
- **Effective Date**: 2021-06-10 (date of promulgation)
- **Scope**: All organizations and individuals within Chinese territory; applies to foreign individuals and organizations implementing discriminatory restrictive measures against Chinese entities

## Key Provisions

The law contains 16 articles with the following core provisions:

1. **Legislative Purpose**: To safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and organizations.

2. **Basic Principles**: Adheres to independent and peaceful foreign policy and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; opposes hegemonism and power politics.

3. **Countermeasures Authority**: Relevant State Council departments may list individuals and organizations that participate in formulating or implementing discriminatory restrictive measures on a countermeasures list.

4. **Types of Countermeasures**:
   - Visa restrictions and entry/exit denials
   - Asset freezing and seizure
   - Prohibition of transactions and cooperation
   - Other necessary measures

5. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - All organizations and individuals within Chinese territory must comply with countermeasures
   - No organization or individual may execute or assist in executing foreign discriminatory restrictions against China
   - Non-compliance may result in legal liability

6. **Jurisdiction**: Applies extraterritorially to foreign entities and individuals engaging in discriminatory measures against Chinese interests.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: This is a speculative analysis based on the regulatory framework**

This law creates significant compliance challenges for multinational companies operating in or trading with China:

- **Conflicting Compliance Obligations**: Companies may face contradictory requirements when both Chinese countermeasures and foreign sanctions target the same entities, forcing difficult choices about which jurisdiction's laws to follow.

- **Supply Chain Disruption Risk**: If a company's suppliers or partners are placed on China's countermeasures list, continuing business relationships could be prohibited, requiring supply chain restructuring.

- **Transaction Restrictions**: The prohibition on transactions with listed entities may impact cross-border payments, trade finance, and logistics services.

- **Export Control Implications**: While this is primarily a counter-sanctions law, it intersects with China's export control regime by creating potential restrictions on technology and goods flows to entities on the countermeasures list.

- **Due Diligence Requirements**: Companies must now screen against both international sanctions lists AND China's countermeasures list to ensure compliance, increasing operational complexity and costs.
