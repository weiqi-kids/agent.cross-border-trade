## Summary

China's Export Control Law establishes a comprehensive legal framework for managing exports of dual-use items, military products, and nuclear materials. The law, effective December 1, 2020, introduces a licensing system with eight assessment factors including national security, international obligations, and end-user risk management.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2020-12-01
- **Scope**: All controlled items including dual-use items, military products, nuclear materials, and related technologies and services

## Key Provisions

### Legal Structure
- **Chapters**: 5 chapters with 49 articles total
- **Presidential Order**: No. 58 issued on October 17, 2020

### Definition of Controlled Items
Controlled items are defined as "goods, technologies, and services that have both civilian and military applications or can enhance military capabilities."

### Licensing System
- National export licensing system for all listed controlled items
- Export permits required for items on the control list
- Eight assessment factors for license evaluation:
  1. National security interests
  2. International obligations
  3. Export destination
  4. End-user identity
  5. End-use purpose
  6. Export applicant's compliance record
  7. Items' characteristics and intended application
  8. Other relevant factors

### Risk Management Mechanisms
- **Expert Consultation Mechanism**: Establishment of technical advisory panels
- **Coordination Bodies**: Inter-agency coordination for export control decisions
- **End-User Risk Management**: System to assess and monitor end-user and end-use risks
- **Control Lists**: Establishment of import and end-user control lists

### Supervision and Enforcement
Enforcement authorities have powers to:
- Conduct inspections and inquiries
- Review documents and records
- Seal and seize items under investigation
- Issue supervisory interviews and warning letters

### Penalties
Violations include unauthorized exports, exceeding licensed scope, or operating without proper qualifications:
- **Fines**: RMB 500,000 to 5,000,000
- **Severe Cases**: Revocation of business qualifications
- **Criminal Liability**: Prosecution for serious violations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

> **Note**: This is a speculative assessment and should be reviewed by a human expert.

### Immediate Impact
- **Semiconductor Supply Chains**: Companies exporting chips, manufacturing equipment, or EDA software to China must navigate the licensing system, potentially causing delays in technology transfers.
- **Aerospace & Defense**: Dual-use aerospace components and technologies face stricter scrutiny, affecting international joint ventures and parts suppliers.
- **Nuclear Energy**: Nuclear-related exports require comprehensive end-user verification, impacting civil nuclear cooperation projects.

### Compliance Requirements
- **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Exporters must implement robust end-user and end-use verification processes
- **Documentation**: Detailed record-keeping for all controlled item transactions
- **License Applications**: Preparation for extended review periods (potentially 30-45 days)

### Strategic Considerations
- **Reciprocity Risk**: The law includes provisions for reciprocal measures against countries discriminating against Chinese exports
- **Technology Transfer**: Increased government oversight of technology licensing and transfer agreements
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: Multinational companies may need to restructure supply chains to reduce exposure to export control uncertainties

### Sector-Specific Impacts
- **Telecommunications**: 5G equipment and technologies subject to dual-use controls
- **Biotechnology**: Certain biological materials and genetic resources under export restrictions
- **Advanced Materials**: Rare earth elements, carbon fiber, and specialized alloys face enhanced controls

## Notes

WebFetch successful. This is China's first comprehensive export control law, marking a significant evolution from previous ad-hoc regulations. The law mirrors international best practices (Wassenaar Arrangement, MTCR) while asserting China's regulatory sovereignty. The eight-factor assessment framework provides discretion for authorities to deny licenses based on broadly defined "national security interests."
