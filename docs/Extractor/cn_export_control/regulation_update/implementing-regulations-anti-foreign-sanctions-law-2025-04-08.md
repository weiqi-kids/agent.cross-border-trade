## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Direct Impacts:**
- **Counter-Sanctions Exposure:** Foreign entities on counter-sanctions lists face comprehensive transaction restrictions with Chinese suppliers, buyers, and partners
- **Asset Freeze Risk:** Properties and funds within Chinese jurisdiction subject to freezing/seizure for designated entities
- **Export License Denials:** Article 9 export controls may block critical component shipments to sanctioned entities (speculative: semiconductors, rare earths, advanced materials)

**Compliance Requirements:**
- **Due Diligence Burden:** Chinese exporters must screen customers against counter-sanctions lists before transactions
- **Banking Restrictions:** Financial institutions must decline transactions involving sanctioned entities
- **Technology Transfer Blocks:** R&D collaborations and technical service agreements with sanctioned parties prohibited

**Strategic Uncertainties (speculative):**
- **Extraterritorial Application:** Regulation does not explicitly clarify whether restrictions apply to third-country transactions involving sanctioned entities
- **Secondary Sanctions Risk:** Foreign companies maintaining business with both sanctioned entities and Chinese markets may face forced choice scenarios
- **Supply Chain Fragmentation:** Reciprocal sanctions dynamics (US/EU sanctions vs. China counter-sanctions) accelerate bifurcation of global supply networks

**Sector Vulnerabilities (speculative):**
- **Technology Hardware:** Entities dependent on Chinese rare earth materials, battery components, or electronics manufacturing capacity face heightened disruption risk if designated
- **Automotive:** EV supply chains (battery cells, cathode materials) may experience delays if counter-sanctions target key Western automakers or suppliers
- **Pharmaceuticals:** API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) sourcing from China may be blocked for sanctioned healthcare entities

**Timeline Implications:**
- Immediate enforcement (2025-04-08 effective date) compresses adaptation windows
- No grace period specified for existing contracts — transactions must halt immediately upon designation (speculative interpretation)
