## Summary

The Nuclear Safety Law of the People's Republic of China establishes a comprehensive legal framework for nuclear safety, covering nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste management, emergency response, and supervision. Enacted on September 1, 2017, by the 12th National People's Congress Standing Committee and effective from January 1, 2018, this law emphasizes the principles of "safety first, prevention primary, clear responsibility, and strict management."

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee (全国人民代表大会常务委员会)
- **Effective Date**: 2018-01-01
- **Scope**: All nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, and radioactive waste within PRC territory and jurisdictional waters; applies to nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel cycle facilities, and radioactive waste disposal sites

## Key Provisions

### Chapter 1: General Provisions (Articles 1-13)
- **Article 1**: Purpose - ensuring nuclear safety, preventing and responding to nuclear accidents, protecting public health and environment

- **Article 48**: Operators must prepay spent fuel processing fees, decommissioning funds, and waste disposal costs in production costs
- **Transport management**: Different categories with security escorts; cross-province transport requires Public Security approval

### Chapter 4: Nuclear Emergency Response (Articles 54-62)

- **Maximum penalties**: Up to RMB 5 million for violations; criminal prosecution for serious cases

### Chapter 8: Supplementary Provisions (Articles 92-94)
- **Definitions**: Nuclear accident, defense-in-depth, operator, nuclear safety equipment, spent fuel, decommissioning, experience feedback
- **Military nuclear safety**: Separately regulated by State Council and Central Military Commission

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This foundational law has significant implications for global nuclear supply chains:

**For Nuclear Equipment Exporters**: Foreign suppliers of nuclear safety equipment to China must register with Chinese authorities (Article 36) and meet stringent quality assurance requirements (Article 17), potentially creating compliance barriers for international vendors.

**For Nuclear Fuel Cycle**: Strict material accounting (Article 38) and transport licensing (Articles 51-52) requirements may affect uranium and enrichment service suppliers, requiring enhanced tracking and security protocols for China-bound materials.

**For Radioactive Waste Management**: The state monopoly on high-level waste disposal (Article 40) and mandatory prepayment requirements (Article 48) create a centralized waste management regime that may affect decommissioning economics for international joint venture projects.

**For Nuclear Operators**: The defense-in-depth requirement (Article 16), lifetime license terms with mandatory 5-year advance renewal review (Article 28), and strict liability regime (Article 90) establish a high-barrier regulatory environment that favors established operators with deep technical and financial resources.

**Compliance Timeline**: The law has been in effect since January 2018, but ongoing implementation through subordinate regulations continues to shape operational requirements. Companies engaged in nuclear trade with China should monitor updates to implementing rules and technical standards.

- **Scope clarification**: While hosted on MOFCOM export control portal, this is a general nuclear safety law, not specifically export control legislation. However, it establishes the domestic regulatory framework that governs nuclear material and technology handling, which directly affects export control implementation (particularly Chapter 3 on nuclear materials).
