## Summary

The State Council issued the Commercial Cryptography Management Regulations (Decree No. 760) on April 27, 2023, effective July 1, 2023, replacing the 1999 regulations. This comprehensive framework governs the research, production, sales, service, and import/export of commercial cryptography products, establishing a unified management system under the State Cryptography Administration while promoting innovation and standardization in the cryptography sector.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国国务院)
- **Effective Date**: 2023-07-01
- **Scope**: All commercial cryptography activities including R&D, production, sales, services, import/export; applies to enterprises, service providers, and critical infrastructure operators using cryptography for non-classified information protection

## Key Provisions

### Chapter 1: General Provisions
- **Definition**: Commercial cryptography refers to technologies, products, and services using specific transformation methods to encrypt and authenticate information that is not classified as state secrets
- **Management Authority**: State Cryptography Administration responsible for unified nationwide management
- **Policy Direction**: Encourages independent innovation, protects intellectual property rights

### Chapter 2: Technology Innovation and Standardization
- Promotes autonomous innovation in commercial cryptography technology
- State standardization authorities and cryptography management departments jointly develop national and industry standards
- Protects intellectual property rights in cryptography research and development

### Chapter 3: Testing and Certification
- Establishes commercial cryptography testing and certification system
- Testing institutions must obtain qualification from State Cryptography Administration
- Application review period: 20 working days
- Certification ensures product quality and security standards

### Chapter 4: Electronic Authentication
- Requires qualification certificates for providing electronic authentication services using commercial cryptography
- Electronic government authentication service providers must meet specific conditions
- Must obtain qualification from State Cryptography Administration

### Chapter 5: Import/Export Control
- **Import Licensing**: Required for commercial cryptography involving national security and public interest
- **Export Control**: Implements control on commercial cryptography exports
- **Application Process**: Submit to commerce department; review period is 45 working days
- **Scope**: Covers cryptography products, technologies, and services that may affect national security

### Chapter 6: Application Promotion
- Encourages use of certified commercial cryptography products
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Operators must use commercial cryptography for protection
- **Security Assessment**: Mandatory application security assessments for critical infrastructure operators
- Promotes widespread adoption of certified cryptography solutions

### Chapter 7: Supervision and Management
- Cryptography management departments conduct lawful supervision and inspection
- Authorized to conduct on-site inspections and investigations
- Establishes credit supervision mechanism for commercial cryptography businesses
- Regular monitoring and compliance verification

### Chapter 8: Legal Liability
- **Penalties**: Warnings, fines (typically RMB 100,000-1,000,000), confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of qualifications
- **Criminal Liability**: Serious violations may result in criminal prosecution
- **Graduated Response**: Penalties proportional to violation severity

### Chapter 9: Supplementary Provisions
- Effective date: July 1, 2023
- Replaces previous regulations from 1999
- Transition arrangements for existing license holders

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact on Technology Suppliers:**
The regulations establish a comprehensive certification and testing regime that may create barriers for foreign cryptography product suppliers entering the Chinese market. Companies exporting cryptography-enabled products to China will need to navigate the import licensing process, which could extend supply chain lead times by up to 45 working days for review plus additional preparation time.

**Impact on Critical Infrastructure Operators:**
Organizations operating critical information infrastructure in China must implement certified commercial cryptography solutions and conduct regular security assessments. This may necessitate supply chain diversification toward domestic or certified cryptography providers, potentially affecting procurement from international vendors.

**Import/Export Considerations:**
The dual-track licensing system (import permits and export controls) introduces regulatory complexity for companies with cross-border cryptography supply chains. The 45-working-day review period for export/import applications should be factored into supply chain planning, particularly for just-in-time delivery models.

**Compliance Timeline:**
With the July 1, 2023 effective date, companies had approximately 2 months from publication to achieve compliance. Organizations that delayed adaptation may have faced supply chain disruptions or market access restrictions in the Chinese cryptography sector.
