## Summary
China's Data Security Law establishes classified and graded data protection requirements, mandates comprehensive data security management systems, and prohibits unauthorized cross-border data transfers. The law implements national security reviews for data processing activities affecting state security, with penalties up to 10 million yuan for violations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-09-01

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Cross-Border Data Transfers**: All international data transfers require assessment and potential approval
- **Data Localization**: Critical data may be required to be stored domestically
- **Security Reviews**: Companies processing sensitive data subject to national security reviews
- **Vendor Management**: Third-party data processors must meet security requirements

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Cloud Services**: Data storage and processing services face stringent security requirements and potential localization mandates
- **E-commerce/Retail**: Customer data collection and transfer subject to consent and security requirements
- **Financial Services**: Financial data classified as important, requiring enhanced protection measures
- **Healthcare/Biotech**: Health and genetic data subject to strict collection and transfer restrictions
- **Telecommunications**: Network operators handle critical infrastructure data, facing highest security standards
- **Automotive/IoT**: Connected devices collecting sensor data must implement data security measures

### Strategic Considerations
- Classified and graded protection system enables differential treatment based on data sensitivity
- National security review mechanism creates approval bottleneck for foreign data access
- Cross-border transfer restrictions may require data duplication or regional processing centers
- Comprehensive management system requirements increase compliance costs significantly
- Enforcement through substantial fines creates strong incentive for proactive compliance
