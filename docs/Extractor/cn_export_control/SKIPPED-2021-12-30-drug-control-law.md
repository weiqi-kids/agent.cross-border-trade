## Reason for Skipping

This article is about China's **Drug Control Law (禁毒法)**, which regulates narcotics and drug trafficking. It does not relate to export control policies.

The article was found in the MOFCOM export control website's legal database (section: laws/gnzcfg/flfg) but does not fit any of the 5 defined categories for the cn_export_control Layer:
- regulation_update
- controlled_item_change
- enforcement_action
- policy_guidance
- international_cooperation

## Article Summary

Passed December 29, 2007, effective June 1, 2008. The law establishes:
- Definition of controlled drugs (opium, heroin, methamphetamine, etc.)
- Drug prevention education requirements
- Licensing for pharmaceutical use of controlled substances
- Community rehabilitation and mandatory isolation treatment programs
- International cooperation on cross-border enforcement
- Criminal penalties for drug trafficking and related offenses

## Notes

While this law may have tangential relevance to export control (some dual-use chemical precursors could be both export-controlled and drug-controlled), the article itself focuses purely on domestic drug control and does not discuss export control aspects.

This article should be excluded from the cn_export_control Layer processing. If drug-related export controls are needed, they should be captured when MOFCOM publishes specific export control guidance on chemical precursors.
