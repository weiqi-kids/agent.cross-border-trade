## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce responded to Japan's September 29 update to its export control end-user list, which added several Chinese enterprises while removing two others. The spokesperson opposed the additions as lacking factual basis while welcoming the removals and calling for enhanced bilateral communication to expand delistings.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce Press Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-30 (statement date; Japan's list update effective September 29)

**Scope:** Chinese enterprises added to and removed from Japan's export control end-user list

## Key Provisions

1. **Opposition to New Listings:** China opposes Japan's listing of Chinese companies "without factual basis" (没有事实依据).

2. **Demand for Cessation:** China demands Japan "immediately cease the erroneous practice of listing Chinese enterprises" (立即停止错误做法,停止将中国企业列单).

3. **Welcome for Removals:** China welcomes the removal of two Chinese companies from the list and seeks to expand such removals through enhanced bilateral communication (中方欢迎日方将两家中国企业从"最终用户清单"中移除,希望通过加强中日沟通,扩大移除名单).

4. **Diplomatic Approach:** The statement balances opposition to new listings with acknowledgment of positive steps (removals), suggesting openness to dialogue.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Medium Impact (speculative):** Japan's end-user list additions create compliance obligations for Japanese exporters of controlled technologies and items to the listed Chinese entities. Companies on the list face increased scrutiny and potential denial of Japanese technology imports, particularly in semiconductors, advanced materials, and precision manufacturing equipment. The removal of two Chinese companies demonstrates that delisting is possible through bilateral engagement, providing a pathway for affected companies to remediate compliance concerns. Chinese entities on Japan's end-user list should engage with both Chinese and Japanese authorities to address the grounds for listing. Japanese exporters should implement robust end-use verification procedures for Chinese customers.

## Notes

This statement reflects China's nuanced approach to Japan's export controls, acknowledging positive developments (removals) while opposing new additions. Japan's end-user list is similar to the US Entity List, restricting exports of controlled items to listed entities without licenses. The timing (September 2025) places this in the context of broader technology competition and export control coordination among US allies. Companies should monitor the official Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announcements for specific entity names.
