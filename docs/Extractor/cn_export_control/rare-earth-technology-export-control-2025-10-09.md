## Summary

The Ministry of Commerce issued Announcement No. 62 of 2025 on October 9, 2025, implementing export controls on rare earth-related technologies. The announcement prohibits export of technologies related to rare earth mining, smelting and separation, metal refining, magnetic material manufacturing, and rare earth secondary resource recycling without prior licensing.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce, People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-09 (effective immediately upon publication)
- **Scope**: Technologies related to the complete rare earth supply chain, from mining to advanced manufacturing and recycling

## Key Provisions

**Controlled Items**:

1. **Rare Earth Extraction and Processing Technologies**:
   - Mining technologies (稀土开采)
   - Smelting and separation technologies (冶炼分离)
   - Metal refining technologies (金属冶炼)

2. **Advanced Manufacturing Technologies**:
   - Magnetic material manufacturing technologies (磁材制造)
   - Rare earth secondary resource recycling and utilization technologies (稀土二次资源回收利用)

3. **Production Support Technologies**:
   - Production line assembly, commissioning, maintenance, repair, and upgrade technologies
   - Technical documentation including design drawings, process specifications, and process parameters

4. **Technology Carriers**: The control applies to technologies "and their carriers" (及其载体), meaning physical media, documents, software, or any form containing the controlled technical information.

**Applicable Entities**: Export operators include "Chinese citizens, legal persons and unincorporated organizations, as well as all natural persons, legal persons and unincorporated organizations within Chinese territory."

**Licensing Requirement**: Export operators must apply for licenses from the Ministry of Commerce before exporting controlled technologies.

**Service Provider Prohibition**: Service providers are prohibited from providing assistance for activities that violate the regulation.

**Public Domain Exception**: Technologies that have already entered the public domain are not subject to control.

**Legal Framework Update**: The announcement simultaneously updates the "Export Control List of Dual-Use Items of the People's Republic of China."

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This export control has far-reaching implications for the global rare earth supply chain:

1. **Technology Transfer Barriers**:
   - Foreign companies seeking to develop rare earth processing capabilities cannot obtain Chinese technology assistance
   - Existing technical cooperation agreements may require renegotiation or termination
   - Maintenance and upgrade services for Chinese-origin rare earth processing equipment now require export licenses

2. **Vertical Integration Pressure**:
   - Companies without in-house rare earth processing capabilities face higher barriers to vertical integration
   - Technology licensing models for rare earth processing become non-viable for exports from China

3. **Equipment and Turnkey Projects**:
   - Turnkey rare earth processing facilities involving Chinese technology suppliers face regulatory hurdles
   - Assembly, commissioning, and maintenance services now require licensing, extending project timelines
   - Technical documentation transfer (design drawings, process specifications) explicitly controlled

4. **Competitive Dynamics**:
   - Chinese rare earth processors gain competitive advantage by retaining proprietary technologies domestically
   - Non-Chinese technology providers may capture market share for regions seeking to diversify supply
   - Strategic value of non-Chinese rare earth technology development increases

5. **Manufacturing Location Decisions**:
   - Incentivizes rare earth end-users (e.g., magnet manufacturers, electric vehicle makers) to locate operations in China to access controlled technologies
   - May accelerate rare earth processing capacity development in alternative jurisdictions (USA, Australia, Vietnam) using non-Chinese technologies

6. **Sectoral Impact**:
   - **Electric Vehicle Industry**: Rare earth permanent magnets are critical for EV motors; magnet manufacturing technology controls impact EV supply chain localization strategies
   - **Wind Energy**: Rare earth magnets used in direct-drive wind turbines face similar constraints
   - **Electronics**: High-performance magnets in consumer electronics and data storage affected
   - **Defense**: Military applications of rare earth materials (guided munitions, radar systems) face technology access limitations

7. **Recycling Industry Impact**:
   - Control of rare earth secondary resource recycling technologies may slow development of circular economy solutions outside China
   - End-of-life magnet and electronic waste processing capacity development constrained

8. **Immediate Operational Impacts**:
   - Chinese technical personnel providing on-site support abroad may require export licenses
   - Remote technical assistance (e.g., process optimization consulting) may fall under control
   - Training programs for foreign personnel at Chinese facilities may require licensing

9. **Strategic Implications**:
   - Complements previous rare earth material export controls, extending control from materials to know-how
   - Part of broader strategy to maintain dominance in rare earth value chain
   - May trigger reciprocal technology controls from other jurisdictions

## Notes

Content retrieved via WebFetch. This announcement represents a significant expansion of China's rare earth export control regime from materials (previously controlled) to technologies and know-how. The immediate effective date (same day as publication) indicates strategic urgency.

The control is particularly comprehensive, covering the entire rare earth technology value chain from mining to recycling, and explicitly including production support services (maintenance, commissioning, upgrades) and technical documentation. This makes it one of the most comprehensive technology export controls in China's export control framework.

Context: China currently dominates global rare earth processing (estimated 85-90% of global capacity) and rare earth magnet production (estimated 90% of global capacity). This technology control further entrenches that dominance by limiting knowledge transfer to potential competitors.
