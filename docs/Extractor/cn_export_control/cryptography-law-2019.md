## Summary

The Cryptography Law of the PRC, enacted by the 13th National People's Congress Standing Committee, establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptography management in China, categorizing cryptographic technologies into three levels (core, common, and commercial) with distinct control requirements. The law mandates import licensing and export controls for commercial cryptographic products with encryption capabilities, while exempting mass consumer products, and requires critical information infrastructure operators to conduct security assessments when procuring cryptographic products.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2020-01-01
- **Scope**: All organizations and individuals engaged in cryptography research, production, sales, import/export, use, and management within the territory of China

## Key Provisions

### Classification System
The law establishes a three-tier classification system for cryptographic technologies:
- **Core Cryptography (核心密码)**: Protects top-secret level information
- **Common Cryptography (普通密码)**: Protects confidential level information
- **Commercial Cryptography (商用密码)**: Protects non-state secret information

### Import/Export Controls (Article 28)
The Ministry of Commerce and the State Cryptography Administration jointly implement:
- **Import licensing regime** for commercial cryptographic products with encryption protection functions
- **Export controls** for commercial cryptographic products with encryption capabilities
- **Exemption**: Mass consumer products are excluded from these controls

### Critical Infrastructure Requirements (Article 27)
Operators of critical information infrastructure must:
- Use commercial cryptography in accordance with regulations
- Conduct security assessments for cryptographic application security
- Submit to national security review when procuring cryptographic products that may affect national security

### Management Structure
- National Cryptography Administration: Unified management authority at the national level
- Local cryptography departments: Management authority at county level and above for their respective regions
- Principle: "Unified leadership, hierarchical responsibility" (统一领导、分级负责)

### Enforcement and Penalties
The law establishes a graduated penalty system including:
- Warnings and corrective orders
- Fines ranging from RMB 30,000 to RMB 1,000,000
- Revocation of relevant qualifications
- Criminal liability for violations of Article 12 (prohibited activities)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Cross-border trade implications** (assessment based on regulatory text):

For **exporters selling to China**: Companies exporting commercial cryptographic products with encryption capabilities to China will likely need to navigate the import licensing process administered by MOFCOM and the State Cryptography Administration. The exemption for "mass consumer products" suggests that specialized industrial encryption equipment, enterprise security solutions, and telecommunications infrastructure components may face stricter scrutiny than consumer electronics.

For **Chinese exporters**: Businesses exporting encryption-enabled products from China will face export control requirements under Article 28. This could affect cross-border supply chains for network equipment, cybersecurity products, and industrial control systems containing cryptographic functions.

For **critical infrastructure procurement**: Foreign suppliers of cryptographic products to Chinese critical information infrastructure operators should anticipate national security review requirements when their products "may affect national security," adding compliance timelines and disclosure obligations to the procurement process.

**Risk considerations**: The law's broad definition of "commercial cryptography" and lack of published implementing regulations (as of the 2021 web publication date) may create uncertainty for cross-border technology transactions. Companies should monitor subsequent MOFCOM and State Cryptography Administration guidance on licensing thresholds, exemption criteria, and security review triggers.

## Notes

WebFetch successful. Full legislative text retrieved from China Ministry of Commerce Export Control Information Network. The law was promulgated on 2019-10-26 and became effective on 2020-01-01. Document classification aligns with "regulation_update" category as it establishes new legal framework with direct export control provisions in Article 28.
