## Summary
This announcement establishes export controls on five categories of heavy rare earth elements and their derivatives, including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, covering metals, alloys, target materials, crystal materials, luminescent materials, optical fiber materials, permanent magnets, and related compounds. The controls become effective November 8, 2025.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs of China
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-08

  - Related compounds

- **1C913 Ytterbium Items**:
  - Metal ytterbium
  - Target materials
  - Crystal materials
  - Optical fiber materials
  - Ytterbium compounds

- **Export Approval Requirements**:
  - Exporters must obtain Ministry of Commerce approval before export
  - Controlled items must be clearly marked on customs declarations with proper classification codes
  - Non-controlled similar items require detailed technical specifications to demonstrate they fall outside control scope

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This assessment represents speculative analysis based on regulatory framework:*

This announcement significantly expands China's rare earth export control regime beyond the lighter rare earths controlled in previous regulations, now targeting heavy rare earths critical to advanced technology applications. The simultaneous control of five heavy rare earth elements represents a comprehensive approach to strategic material management.

**Critical Industry Impacts**:

- **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: Holmium and erbium target materials are essential for advanced chip fabrication; this may create bottlenecks for fab equipment suppliers
- **Telecommunications**: Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are fundamental to long-haul optical networks; controls on erbium optical fiber materials could affect network infrastructure expansion
- **Display Industry**: Europium and thulium luminescent materials are critical for OLED and LED displays; display manufacturers should secure multi-year supply agreements
- **Laser Technology**: Thulium and erbium crystal materials power medical, military, and industrial laser systems
- **Permanent Magnets**: Holmium additions improve magnet performance for electric motors and sensors

**Strategic Considerations**:
- China produces >90% of global heavy rare earth supply; alternative sources (Myanmar, Vietnam) have limited capacity
- The November 8, 2025 effective date aligns with lithium battery controls (Announcement No. 58), suggesting coordinated technology supply chain strategy
- Including compounds and alloys prevents circumvention through partial processing
- Target material controls directly impact semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment supply chains

**Recommended Actions**:
- Technology manufacturers should conduct rare earth content audits across component supply chains
- Establish strategic inventory buffers (6-12 months) for critical heavy rare earth materials
- Engage with Ministry of Commerce early for recurring export approvals
- Explore rare earth recycling and circular economy solutions to reduce import dependency
- Monitor Myanmar and Vietnam production capacity expansion as potential alternative sources
