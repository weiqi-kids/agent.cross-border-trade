## Summary

The State Council issued Order No. 792 announcing the new Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items, adopted at the 41st Executive Meeting on September 18, 2024, promulgated on September 30, 2024, and effective from December 1, 2024. This regulation consolidates and replaces previous separate regulations on nuclear dual-use items, missile-related items, biological dual-use items, and chemical dual-use items.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (signed by Premier Li Qiang)
- **Effective Date**: 2024-12-01
- **Scope**: Applies to all dual-use items exported from China, including goods, technologies, and services that have both civilian and military applications, particularly those related to weapons of mass destruction

## Key Provisions

**Definition**: Dual-use items are defined as goods, technologies, and services that "have both civilian use and military use or contribute to enhancing military potential," especially those related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems.

**Licensing Framework**: Establishes three types of licenses:
1. Individual licenses (valid up to 1 year)
2. General licenses (valid up to 3 years)
3. Registration and reporting requirements

**Documentation Requirements**: Exporters must submit end-user and end-use certificates demonstrating the final recipient and intended purpose.

**Risk Management System**: Implements dual-list approach:
- "Control List" (管控名单) for high-risk entities
- "Watch List" (关注名单) for entities requiring enhanced due diligence

**Institutional Responsibility**: Commerce department under the State Council is the lead authority for export control implementation, with coordination from relevant government agencies.

**Legal Liability**: Violations are subject to:
- Administrative warnings
- Fines up to 10 times the illegal transaction value
- Confiscation of illegal proceeds
- Criminal prosecution for serious offenses

**Consolidation**: This regulation repeals four previous regulations:
1. Regulations on Export Control of Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technologies
2. Regulations on Export Control of Missile-Related Items and Technologies
3. Regulations on Export Control of Biological Dual-Use Items and Related Equipment and Technologies
4. Regulations on Export Control of Dual-Use Biological Agents and Related Equipment and Technologies, and Certain Chemicals and Related Equipment and Technologies

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This consolidated regulation represents a significant evolution in China's export control regime with substantial supply chain implications:

1. **Unified Framework**: The consolidation from four separate regulations into one unified framework may streamline compliance for companies dealing with multiple categories of dual-use items, potentially reducing administrative complexity.

2. **Expanded Scope**: The inclusion of "services" alongside goods and technologies broadens the control scope, potentially affecting technical support, maintenance, training, and consulting services related to controlled items.

3. **Extended License Validity**: General licenses valid up to 3 years may reduce administrative burden for established, low-risk trade relationships compared to annual renewals.

4. **Enhanced Due Diligence**: The dual-list system (Control List and Watch List) requires exporters to implement more robust customer screening and monitoring systems, increasing compliance costs.

5. **Transaction Delays**: End-user certificate requirements and risk assessments may extend transaction timelines, impacting supply chain velocity for dual-use items.

6. **Sectoral Impact**: Industries most affected include:
   - Nuclear technology and materials
   - Aerospace and missile systems
   - Biotechnology and life sciences
   - Chemical manufacturing
   - Advanced manufacturing equipment
   - Semiconductor and electronics

7. **Extraterritorial Considerations**: Foreign companies with operations in China or sourcing dual-use items from China will need to ensure compliance with both Chinese export controls and their home country regulations (e.g., US EAR, EU Dual-Use Regulation).
