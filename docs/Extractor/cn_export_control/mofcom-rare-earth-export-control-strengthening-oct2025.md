## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce issued two announcements (No. 61 and No. 62 of 2025) establishing enhanced export controls on rare earth-related items and technologies. The controls target foreign rare earth items containing Chinese components and restrict rare earth technology exports, while including humanitarian exemptions and transition periods for existing contracts.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 中华人民共和国商务部 (Ministry of Commerce, PRC)

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-09 (announcement date; specific implementation dates may vary by provision)

**Scope:** Rare earth-related items and technologies, including foreign products containing Chinese rare earth components

## Key Provisions

1. **Announcement 2025-61 (Foreign Items with Chinese Components):** Controls "foreign rare earth-related items containing Chinese components" (含中国成分的外国稀土相关物项) based on export control laws. The spokesperson noted: "此次纳入管制的物项范围有限,同时将采取多种许可便利措施" (the scope of controlled items is limited, with multiple licensing convenience measures to be adopted).

2. **Announcement 2025-62 (Technology Exports):** Restricts rare earth technology exports. Rare earth items are classified as dual-use goods; relevant technologies were listed in China's restricted export technology catalog since 2001.

3. **Humanitarian Exemptions:** Exports for emergency medical care, public health crises, or disaster relief require no license (用于紧急医疗救护、应对突发公共卫生事件或救灾的出口,无需许可).

4. **Transition Period:** The policy includes reasonable implementation timelines for existing contracts and compliance requirements (合理的实施过渡期).

5. **Licensing Convenience Measures:** Multiple licensing facilitation measures will be adopted to minimize disruption to legitimate trade (多种许可便利措施).

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High Impact (speculative):** These controls represent a significant expansion of China's rare earth export control regime, particularly the novel application to "foreign rare earth-related items containing Chinese components." This provision creates extraterritorial effects, potentially requiring licenses for re-export of products manufactured outside China if they contain Chinese rare earth materials. Companies in the permanent magnet, electronics, defense, renewable energy, and electric vehicle sectors should immediately assess their supply chains for Chinese rare earth content. The technology export restrictions under Announcement 2025-62 may impact joint ventures and technology licensing agreements. While licensing convenience measures and humanitarian exemptions provide some flexibility, companies should prepare for increased compliance costs and potential supply delays.

## Notes

The timing of these announcements (October 9, 2025) coincides with the addition of entities to the Unreliable Entity List (Announcement 1174), suggesting a coordinated policy package. Rare earth elements are critical inputs for high-technology applications including magnets, batteries, displays, and defense systems. China produces over 60% of global rare earths and dominates processing capacity, giving these controls significant leverage in technology supply chains. The reference to "multiple licensing convenience measures" suggests China aims to maintain rare earth trade volumes while asserting control over strategic end-uses.
