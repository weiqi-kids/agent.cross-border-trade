## Summary
The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation published the "2023 Dutch Export Control Policy" report on November 5, 2024, revealing that dual-use items licenses increased 34.63% to 898 licenses in 2023, with total value rising to nearly 21 billion euros. South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States were the top three destinations by value.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation
- **Effective Date**: N/A (Statistical report covering 2023)
- **Scope**: Dual-use items export licenses issued by the Netherlands in 2023

## Key Provisions
- **Report Publication**: "2023 Dutch Export Control Policy" report submitted to parliament on November 5, 2024
- **License Statistics**:
  - **Total Licenses Issued**: 898 licenses for dual-use items (2022: 667 licenses)
  - **Growth Rate**: 34.63% year-over-year increase
  - **Total Value**: Nearly 21 billion euros (2022: over 20 billion euros)
  - **Licenses Denied**: Only 14 applications rejected (2022: 32 rejections)
- **Top Export Destinations by Value**:
  1. South Korea: 3.895 billion euros
  2. Taiwan, China: 3.437 billion euros
  3. United States: 2.329 billion euros
  4. China (mainland): 253 million euros (ranked 6th)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This section contains speculative analysis based on available information.*

**Potential Impacts:**
- **Semiconductor Industry**: The dominance of South Korea and Taiwan as top destinations strongly suggests that advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (notably ASML lithography systems) constitutes the majority of export value
- **East Asia Concentration**: Top 3 destinations account for significant portion of exports, indicating Netherlands' critical role in Asian high-tech manufacturing supply chains
- **China Position**: Mainland China ranks 6th with only 253 million euros (approximately 1.2% of total), likely reflecting existing semiconductor export restrictions
- **Approval Rate**: High approval rate (98.4%) suggests most applications meet policy requirements, though China-bound applications may face higher scrutiny
- **Policy Effectiveness**: Increase in approvals alongside semiconductor equipment restrictions indicates selective control approach targeting specific technologies and destinations
- **2024-2025 Outlook**: Given expanded semiconductor controls announced in September 2024, future reports may show shifts in destination patterns

## Notes

- **Original Source**: Netherlands Government website
- **Article Type**: Compiled news (编译)
- **Data Transparency**: Netherlands provides detailed public reporting on export control implementation
- **Semiconductor Context**: The Netherlands (via ASML) is sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment essential for advanced chip manufacturing
- **Policy Evolution**: These 2023 statistics predate the September 2024 expanded semiconductor controls reported in earlier article
- **Comparative Analysis**: Decline in denials (32→14) alongside stricter semiconductor policies suggests most China-related restrictions implemented through item-specific controls rather than case-by-case denials
