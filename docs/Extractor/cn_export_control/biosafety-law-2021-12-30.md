## Summary
China's Biosafety Law establishes biosafety as a core component of national security, creating comprehensive frameworks for disease prevention, biotechnology research safety, pathogen laboratory regulation, genetic resource protection, and bioterrorism prevention. Penalties range from 50,000 to 1 billion yuan depending on violation severity.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-04-15
- **Scope**: Infectious disease control, biotechnology research, laboratory safety, genetic resources, invasive species, bioterrorism prevention

## Key Provisions

### Ten-Chapter Structure

1. **General Provisions**: Defines biosafety as "effective prevention and response to dangerous biological agents"; establishes biosafety as core national security component

2. **Risk Prevention System**: Creates national coordination mechanism led by health, agriculture, science, and foreign affairs departments; establishes monitoring systems, information sharing platforms, and emergency protocols

3. **Disease and Epidemic Prevention**: Requires reporting of infectious diseases and animal/plant epidemics; establishes joint prevention mechanisms and international border control protocols

4. **Biotechnology Research Safety**:
   - Prohibits dangerous biotechnology activities
   - Requires risk classification and approval for high/medium-risk research
   - Mandates traceability for sensitive equipment and biological agents

5. **Pathogen Laboratory Safety**: Regulates laboratory licensing, classification, personnel access, waste management, and equipment standards with strict oversight for high-level facilities

6. **Genetic Resources Protection**:
   - Restricts collection and export of human genetic resources
   - Requires approvals for international research cooperation
   - Protects against invasive species

7. **Bioterrorism Prevention**: Prohibits biological weapons development; establishes monitoring of materials usable for bioterrorism and response protocols for attacks

8. **Capacity Building**: Mandates infrastructure development, scientific research, personnel training, and emergency supply stockpiling

9. **Legal Liability**: Prescribes penalties ranging from warnings to criminal prosecution, with fines from 50,000 to 1 billion yuan

10. **Supplementary Provisions**: Defines key terminology including biological agents, novel diseases, and biological weapons

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Biotechnology Research**: All high/medium-risk research requires pre-approval and ongoing monitoring
- **Laboratory Equipment**: Sensitive equipment sales require traceability systems
- **Biological Agent Trade**: Pathogen transfers subject to strict licensing and tracking
- **Genetic Resource Access**: Foreign access to Chinese genetic resources requires government approval

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: Drug development using genetic resources faces new approval requirements
- **Agricultural Biotech**: GMO research and invasive species controls impact seed/crop development
- **Medical Devices**: Equipment capable of handling pathogens subject to traceability requirements
- **International Research**: Cross-border collaboration requires explicit approvals and data sharing controls

### Strategic Considerations
- Law enables denial of genetic resource access on national security grounds
- Bioterrorism provisions create dual-use controls on biological agents and equipment
- International border controls may disrupt biological sample shipments
- Emergency supply stockpiling requirements affect pharmaceutical/medical device inventories
