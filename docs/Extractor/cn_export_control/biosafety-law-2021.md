## Summary

The Biosafety Law of the People's Republic of China establishes a comprehensive national biosafety framework addressing disease control, biotechnology research risk management, pathogenic microorganism laboratory standards, human genetic resource protection, and invasive species prevention. The law introduces biosecurity review procedures for significant transactions and international technology transfers, impacting cross-border biological material trade and genetic resource collaboration.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee (第十三届全国人民代表大会常务委员会)
- **Effective Date**: 2021-04-15
- **Scope**: National biosafety governance covering biotechnology research, pathogenic microorganisms, human genetic resources, laboratory operations, and international biological material transfers

## Key Provisions

**Governance Structure**:
- Central security leadership coordinates national biosafety strategy with inter-agency coordination mechanism involving health, agriculture, science, foreign affairs, and military branches
- Provincial governments implement local oversight

**Controlled Activities**:
- High-risk biotechnology research requiring government approval
- Pathogenic sample collection, storage, and transport under strict protocols
- Human genetic resource extraction and international sharing subject to approval
- Laboratory equipment and special biological agents designated in control lists
- Biosecurity-relevant international technology transfers subject to review

**Control Mechanisms**:
- Establishment of national biosecurity review procedures (国家建立生物安全审查制度) for significant transactions
- Disease outbreak monitoring and response protocols
- Biotechnology research risk classification system (high/medium/low)
- Pathogenic microorganism laboratory certification requirements
- Border inspection requirements for biological materials

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[Speculative Analysis]**: The biosecurity review procedures likely create additional compliance requirements for international biotech companies operating in or trading with China. Foreign entities seeking to access Chinese human genetic resources will face heightened scrutiny and approval processes, potentially extending project timelines by 3-6 months. Equipment traceability and registration mandates may require supply chain partners to implement new documentation systems for biological material handling. The restrictions on international technology transfers could impact cross-border R&D collaborations and clinical trial material shipments, particularly for biologics and vaccines. Companies should anticipate due diligence requests regarding biosafety protocols when engaging with Chinese research institutions or biotech partners.
