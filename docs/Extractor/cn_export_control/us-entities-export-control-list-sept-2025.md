## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** High

**Affected Industries:**
- Defense contracting and shipbuilding (Huntington Ingalls Industries)
- Management consulting and government services (Planate Management Group)
- Engineering and technical services (Global Dimensions LLC)

**Geographic Considerations (speculative):**
- Huntington Ingalls Industries is a major US naval shipbuilder, suggesting this action targets defense supply chains
- Chinese suppliers of dual-use items to these entities must immediately halt shipments
- Existing contracts involving controlled items face disruption or require MOFCOM exception approval
- Third-party suppliers using Chinese-origin dual-use items may also be affected through supply chain traceability requirements

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Chinese exporters must verify customer entities against the export control list before shipments
- Entity screening systems must be updated to include these three additions
- Ongoing contracts require legal review and potential MOFCOM exception applications
- Documentation of cessation of activities may be required for compliance verification

## Notes

This announcement was issued on the same date as the Unreliable Entity List update (Announcement No. 9), suggesting coordinated enforcement actions. The inclusion of defense contractors indicates strategic considerations in entity selection. Companies should establish robust end-user screening procedures and maintain updated entity lists.
