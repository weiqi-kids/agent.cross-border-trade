## Summary
China's Counter-Foreign Sanctions Law establishes legal framework for responding to foreign sanctions through countermeasures including visa denial, asset freezing, and transaction restrictions. The law prohibits Chinese entities from complying with foreign discriminatory restrictions and extends measures to family members and controlled entities of sanctioned parties.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-06-10 (publication date)
- **Scope**: Individuals and organizations involved in implementing discriminatory restrictions against China; extends to family members and controlled entities

## Key Provisions

### Legal Basis
**Article 1**: Enacted to protect national sovereignty, security, and development interests, plus safeguard citizens' and organizations' legitimate rights against foreign discriminatory restrictions

### Countermeasure Authority
**Article 4**: Government departments may designate individuals and organizations involved in implementing discriminatory restrictions against China to a countermeasures list

Triggers for listing:
- Direct formulation, decision, or implementation of discriminatory measures against Chinese citizens or organizations
- Participation in implementation of discriminatory restrictions

### Enforcement Actions
**Article 6**: Permitted countermeasures include:
- Visa denial, entry denial, or visa cancellation
- Deportation from China
- Asset freezing and seizure within Chinese territory
- Prohibition or restriction on transactions and cooperation with Chinese citizens and organizations
- Other necessary measures

### Scope Expansion
**Article 5**: Countermeasures may extend to:
- Spouse and immediate family members of listed individuals
- Senior managers and actual controllers of listed organizations
- Organizations controlled or actually controlled by listed individuals
- Organizations where listed individuals serve in senior management

### Domestic Compliance Requirements
**Article 11**: Chinese organizations and individuals must implement countermeasures; violations face legal consequences

### Prohibition Against Foreign Compliance
**Article 12**: "Any organization and individual shall not execute or assist in executing discriminatory restriction measures" imposed by foreign states

Consequences for violation:
- Legal liability under Chinese law
- Right of affected parties to seek compensation in Chinese courts

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Transaction Prohibitions**: Chinese entities cannot transact with individuals/organizations on countermeasures list
- **Asset Freezing**: Property and funds of listed entities within China subject to seizure
- **Contract Enforcement**: Chinese courts will not enforce contracts implementing foreign sanctions
- **Banking/Financial Services**: Chinese financial institutions must cease services to listed entities

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **International Trade**: Companies must navigate both US/EU sanctions and Chinese countermeasures, creating "dual compliance" dilemmas
- **Financial Services**: Banks face conflicting obligations between Western sanctions and Chinese counter-sanctions
- **Technology/IP**: Technology licensing and cooperation agreements disrupted by reciprocal restrictions
- **Professional Services**: Law firms, consultants, auditors may face conflicts between client obligations and Chinese law
- **Transportation/Logistics**: Shipping and aviation companies must comply with Chinese restrictions while maintaining global operations

### Strategic Considerations
- **Extraterritorial Reach**: Law extends Chinese jurisdiction over foreign entities' actions affecting China
- **Reciprocal Blocking**: Creates legal basis for China to mirror Western sanctions and blocking statutes
- **Compliance Conflicts**: Companies operating in multiple jurisdictions face impossible compliance situations
- **Deterrence Effect**: Threat of countermeasures may discourage foreign entities from participating in sanctions against China
- **Legal Uncertainty**: Broad "other necessary measures" language creates unpredictable enforcement risks

## Notes
Successfully retrieved full text via WebFetch. This law was adopted and took effect June 10, 2021, by the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress. It represents China's direct legislative response to Western sanctions, particularly US secondary sanctions affecting Chinese entities. The law creates a reciprocal blocking statute similar to EU Blocking Regulation but with broader enforcement mechanisms.
