## Summary
The Nuclear Safety Law of the People's Republic of China, enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 1, 2017, establishes a comprehensive legal framework for nuclear facility safety, nuclear material control, and radioactive waste management. The law became effective on January 1, 2018, imposing full responsibility on nuclear facility operators for safety compliance with multi-layered protective requirements.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2018-01-01
- **Scope**: All nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, and radioactive waste operations within the People's Republic of China; applies to licensing, operation, material control, waste disposal, emergency response, and regulatory oversight

## Key Provisions
- **Operator Responsibility**: Nuclear facility operating units bear full legal responsibility for nuclear safety at their facilities
- **Licensing System**: Comprehensive permit requirements for nuclear facility construction, operation, and material handling
- **Nuclear Material Control**: Strict management protocols for nuclear material security and accounting
- **Radioactive Waste Management**: Classification system and disposal requirements for radioactive waste
- **Emergency Response**: Mandatory emergency preparedness and response protocols for nuclear incidents
- **Public Disclosure**: Requirements for information transparency regarding nuclear safety matters
- **Regulatory Inspection**: Authority for State Council nuclear safety supervisory department to conduct inspections and enforce compliance
- **Financial Mechanisms**: Financial responsibility requirements to ensure resources for safety and incident management
- **Penalties**: Criminal and administrative sanctions for violations of nuclear safety regulations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
This law potentially impacts international suppliers of nuclear equipment, materials, and services to China by establishing strict safety compliance requirements. Foreign entities involved in nuclear cooperation with Chinese operators may need to demonstrate adherence to enhanced safety standards, documentation requirements, and regulatory inspection protocols. The law's comprehensive licensing system may extend approval timelines for import/export of controlled nuclear items. Export control authorities in other jurisdictions should note that this domestic safety law complements China's export control regime for nuclear and dual-use items, potentially affecting re-export considerations and end-use verification requirements.
