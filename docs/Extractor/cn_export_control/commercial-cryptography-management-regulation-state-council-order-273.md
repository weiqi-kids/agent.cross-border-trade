## Summary

The Commercial Cryptography Management Regulation (State Council Order No. 273) establishes a comprehensive licensing and approval system for all aspects of commercial cryptography in China, including R&D, manufacturing, sales, import/export, and usage. Issued by the State Council and effective from October 7, 1999, this foundational regulation requires state approval for cryptographic products and prohibits the use of unapproved domestic or foreign cryptographic technologies.

## Key Provisions

### 1. Controlled Items and Activities

**Commercial Cryptography Definition:**
Encryption protection or security authentication technologies and products that do not involve state secrets.

**Controlled Activities:**
- Research and development (研发)
- Manufacturing and production (生产制造)
- Sales and distribution (销售)
- Import/export (进出口)
- Usage (使用)

### 2. Research and Production Controls

- Only state-designated entities (国家指定单位) may conduct R&D and manufacturing of commercial cryptography products
- Products require approval and quality inspection before distribution
- Unauthorized production is prohibited

### 3. Sales Controls

- Sellers must obtain licensing from the cryptography management authority (密码管理机构)
- Mandatory user registry requirements including:
  - User names and addresses
  - Product applications and purposes
- Licensed sellers must comply with supervision and inspection

### 4. Usage Controls

**Critical Requirement:**
"Any organization or individual may only use commercial cryptography products recognized by the state cryptography management authority."

This provision prohibits:
- Self-developed cryptographic solutions not approved by authorities
- Foreign-origin cryptographic products without approval
- Unapproved commercial cryptographic technologies

### 5. Import/Export Controls

**Core Provision:**
"Import of cryptography products and equipment containing cryptographic technology or export of commercial cryptography products must be approved by the national cryptography authority."

**Requirements:**
- Pre-approval required for both imports and exports
- Covers finished products and equipment containing cryptographic technology
- National cryptography authority has exclusive approval jurisdiction

### 6. Enforcement Mechanisms

**Administrative Penalties:**
- Warnings (警告)
- Confiscation of products and illegal gains (没收产品和违法所得)
- Fines up to 3 times illegal gains (罚款最高为违法所得的3倍)
- License revocation for serious violations (吊销许可证)

**Criminal Prosecution:**
- Applicable for leaking trade secrets
- Applicable for unauthorized cryptographic attacks
- Applicable for violations causing security incidents

**Administrative Detention:**
- Available for security-related violations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High Impact Areas (speculative assessment):**

**1. Technology Hardware Exports to China**
- Any hardware containing encryption chips or cryptographic modules requires approval from Chinese cryptography authorities before import
- Potential delays or denials for products with unapproved cryptographic implementations
- Affected sectors: telecommunications equipment, network security devices, IoT devices, mobile devices

**2. Software and Cloud Services**
- Foreign software using cryptography must obtain approval for use in China
- Cloud service providers must use state-approved cryptographic solutions
- Potential market access barriers for foreign cybersecurity and encryption software vendors

**3. Dual-Use Technology Compliance**
- Companies exporting commercial cryptography products from China require pre-approval
- Chinese manufacturers of products containing cryptography face licensing requirements
- Cross-border data transfer solutions must comply with approved cryptographic standards

**4. Supply Chain Security**
- Foreign companies operating in China may need to implement approved Chinese cryptographic standards
- Potential requirement to disclose cryptographic implementations for approval
- Risk of technology disclosure in approval process

**5. Trade Flow Considerations**
- Import clearance delays for technology products pending cryptography approval
- Potential for retroactive enforcement on products already in Chinese market
- Need for dedicated compliance processes for cryptographic technology transfers
