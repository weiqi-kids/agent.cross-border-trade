## Summary
The European Commission published its first annual report on dual-use export controls covering 2022-2024, revealing €57.3 billion in approved exports in 2022 (2% of EU external goods exports) and 831 denials worth €980 million, reflecting strengthened control enforcement compared to 2021 data.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: European Commission
- **Effective Date**: Report published January 31, 2025
- **Scope**: EU-wide dual-use export control activities from 2022-2024
- **Legal Basis**: Dual-Use Export Control Regulation 2021

## Key Provisions
**2022 Export Statistics:**
- **Approved dual-use exports**: €57.3 billion
  - Represents 2% of total EU external goods exports
- **Denied exports**: 831 applications worth €980 million
  - Represents 0.03% of dual-use export applications
  - Primary basis: security risks

**2021 Comparison Data:**
- **Approved exports**: €38.5 billion (1.8% of external goods exports)
- **Denied exports**: 568 applications (0.01% of applications)

**Year-over-Year Trends:**
- Approved export value increased 49% (€38.5B → €57.3B)
- Denial rate increased from 0.01% to 0.03% (3x increase)
- Number of denials increased 46% (568 → 831)
- Denied export value increased significantly

**Report Assessment:**
The report concludes that the EU and member states have strengthened scrutiny of dual-use exports, reflecting enhanced regulatory enforcement trends.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Increased Scrutiny Environment:**
- Despite export value growth, denial rates tripled, indicating stricter enforcement
- Exporters face higher probability of license denial for security-sensitive destinations
- Enhanced due diligence requirements for compliance

**Volume Growth Context:**
- €57.3 billion in dual-use exports demonstrates EU's critical role in global technology supply chains
- Growth may reflect increased demand for semiconductors, telecommunications, cybersecurity equipment
- 2% of total exports shows dual-use trade significance beyond niche markets

**Denial Pattern Implications:**
- €980 million in denied exports (0.03% of applications) represents high-value, strategic items
- Security risk as primary denial reason suggests geopolitical factors driving enforcement
- Likely destinations include Russia, China, and other countries of concern

**Strategic Considerations:**
- First annual report under 2021 Regulation establishes transparency baseline
- Enhanced enforcement aligns with broader Western technology protection efforts
- Companies should anticipate continued or increased scrutiny in coming years

**Compliance Best Practices:**
- Internal compliance programs must account for stricter enforcement environment
- Enhanced end-use and end-user verification critical
- Diversification of supply chains to reduce dependency on high-risk destinations

**Sector-Specific Impact:**
- Advanced electronics and semiconductors likely comprise significant portion
- Cybersecurity and surveillance technologies face heightened scrutiny
- Aerospace and defense-adjacent dual-use items subject to careful review
