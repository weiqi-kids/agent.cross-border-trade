## Summary

China's State Council issued comprehensive export control regulations for dual-use items (两用物项) on September 30, 2024 (State Council Order No. 792), which will take effect on December 1, 2024. These regulations consolidate previous separate frameworks for nuclear, missile, biological, and chemical dual-use items into a unified licensing system. The regulations establish a three-tier licensing mechanism (single-item licenses, general/comprehensive licenses, and registration-based certificates), implement end-user/end-use controls, and create monitoring lists for entities posing security risks. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) is designated as the responsible authority for administration and enforcement.

- **Implementation Date**: December 1, 2024
- **Order Number**: State Council Order No. 792
- **Responsible Department**: Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)

## Key Provisions

### 1. Definition of Dual-Use Items (两用物项)
Dual-use items are defined as "goods, technologies and services that have both civilian and military applications or can enhance military potential, particularly those usable in designing, developing, producing or utilizing weapons of mass destruction."

### 2. Licensing System
- **Single-item licenses**: Valid up to 1 year for specific export transactions
- **General/comprehensive licenses**: Valid up to 3 years for qualified exporters with good compliance records
- **Registration-based export certificates**: Available for specific circumstances defined by regulations

### 3. End-User/End-Use Management
- Exporters must submit "end-user certificates" (最终用户证明) confirming final recipients and intended uses
- Recipients cannot alter purposes without authorization
- Transfer to third parties requires prior approval from MOFCOM

### 4. Monitoring and Control Lists
- **Attention lists** (关注清单): For entities failing to cooperate with verification procedures
- **Control lists** (管制清单): For entities violating requirements or posing national security risks
- Entities on control lists face enhanced scrutiny or export prohibitions

### 5. Administrative Authority
- MOFCOM manages dual-use items export control coordination with relevant departments including:
  - Ministry of Foreign Affairs
  - National Development and Reform Commission
  - Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
  - Public Security agencies
  - General Administration of Customs
  - Military authorities

### 6. Penalties
- **Administrative penalties**: Warnings, confiscation of illegal gains, fines ranging from 500,000 to 3,000,000 yuan depending on violation severity
- **Criminal prosecution**: For serious breaches of export control regulations
- **License revocation**: For repeated or severe violations

### 7. International Cooperation
The regulations explicitly reference compliance with international treaties and United Nations Security Council resolutions on non-proliferation and export controls.

### 8. Consolidation of Previous Frameworks
These regulations consolidate previously separate frameworks for:
- Nuclear dual-use items
- Missile-related dual-use items
- Biological dual-use items
- Chemical dual-use items

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*Note: This section contains speculative analysis based on the regulatory text*

### Immediate Impact (Q4 2024)
- **Exporters**: Companies exporting dual-use items from China must upgrade compliance systems before December 1, 2024. Transition period likely minimal, requiring immediate investment in license application procedures and end-user verification protocols.
- **Foreign buyers**: International companies sourcing dual-use technologies or materials from China should expect extended lead times (estimated 2-8 weeks for license processing) and enhanced documentation requirements.

### Short-term Impact (2025)
- **Supply chain disruption risk**: Medium-high for sectors including semiconductors, advanced manufacturing equipment, aerospace components, chemical precursors, and biotechnology equipment. Companies without established relationships or clear civilian end-uses may face license denials.
- **Compliance costs**: Exporters likely to incur additional costs estimated at 3-5% of transaction value for documentation, legal review, and administrative processing.
- **Monitoring lists impact**: Entities placed on "control lists" may face de facto export bans, creating alternative sourcing pressures.

### Long-term Strategic Implications
- **Supply chain bifurcation**: Regulations may accelerate dual supply chain strategies where Western companies source non-dual-use items from China while developing alternative sources for controlled items.
- **Technology transfer restrictions**: General/comprehensive licenses (3-year validity) may be strategically granted to favor domestic Chinese companies or specific countries aligned with China's foreign policy interests.
- **Reciprocal measures**: Other jurisdictions may respond with similar consolidated export control frameworks, potentially creating competing regulatory ecosystems.

### Sectors Most Affected
1. **Semiconductors and microelectronics**: Manufacturing equipment, materials, and design software
2. **Aerospace and aviation**: Components, materials, and technical services
3. **Advanced materials**: Carbon fiber, specialty metals, composite materials
4. **Chemicals**: Precursors with dual-use applications
5. **Biotechnology**: Research equipment, genetic materials, and related technologies
6. **Telecommunications**: Certain equipment and cryptographic technologies

## Notes

- **WebFetch successful**: Full article content retrieved and analyzed on 2026-01-28
- **Regulatory consolidation**: This represents China's most comprehensive unification of export control regimes for dual-use items, replacing multiple previous regulations
- **Implementation timeline**: 2-month window (September 30 to December 1, 2024) for industry preparation is notably short for regulations of this scope
- **Alignment with international norms**: The regulations incorporate terminology and structures similar to multilateral export control regimes (e.g., Wassenaar Arrangement concepts), while maintaining Chinese sovereignty over implementation
- **End-user verification**: The emphasis on end-user certificates and post-export monitoring represents a significant expansion of Chinese regulatory reach into foreign supply chains
- **Penalty structure**: The fine ranges (500,000 to 3,000,000 yuan or approximately $69,000 to $415,000 USD) are substantial and comparable to Western export control penalties
- **Extraterritorial implications**: While not explicitly stated, the end-user controls and prohibition on unauthorized re-export suggest potential extraterritorial enforcement similar to US EAR or EU Dual-Use Regulation frameworks
