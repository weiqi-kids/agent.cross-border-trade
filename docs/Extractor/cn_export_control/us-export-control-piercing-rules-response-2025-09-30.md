## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce strongly criticized the U.S. Commerce Department's September 29, 2025 announcement of new export control piercing rules that extend sanctions to subsidiaries with over 50% ownership stakes of companies on the U.S. Entity List. China characterized this as a typical example of broadening national security concepts and misusing export controls, causing damage to legitimate business interests and destabilizing global supply chains.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce Press Office (商务部新闻办公室)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-09-29 (U.S. announcement)
- **Scope**: Subsidiaries with over 50% ownership stakes of U.S. Entity List companies

## Key Provisions
- **U.S. Policy**: New piercing rules extend sanctions to majority-owned (>50%) subsidiaries of Entity List companies
- **China's Characterization**: Describes as "typical example" of Washington broadening national security concepts and misusing export controls
- **Impact Assessment**: Measures are "extremely objectionable" and damage affected enterprises' legitimate interests
- **Supply Chain Concern**: Destabilizes international trade and global supply chains
- **China's Demand**: Urges U.S. to "immediately correct its erroneous approach" and cease pressuring Chinese companies
- **Countermeasures**: China pledges to take necessary countermeasures to protect Chinese business interests

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
The U.S. piercing rules significantly expand the reach of export controls by targeting subsidiaries of Entity List companies, effectively closing loopholes where restricted entities could access controlled items through related corporate entities. This forces multinational corporations to conduct deeper ownership analysis and extended due diligence across complex corporate structures. Chinese companies with subsidiaries in third countries face increased compliance burdens and potential isolation from global technology supply chains. The rule change represents a structural shift toward more comprehensive entity-based controls rather than transaction-based restrictions.
