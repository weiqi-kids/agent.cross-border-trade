## Summary

In response to the China-US Kuala Lumpur economic and trade consultations consensus, China's Ministry of Commerce announced adjustments to export control lists affecting 31 U.S. entities. Starting November 10, 2025, controls on 15 entities from Announcement No. 13 will be lifted, while controls on 16 entities from Announcement No. 21 will remain suspended for one year. Exporters may apply for licenses to export dual-use items to these entities, subject to regulatory review.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Scope**: 31 U.S. entities previously listed in Announcement No. 13 (March 4, 2025) and Announcement No. 21 (April 4, 2025)

## Key Provisions

### Background Context
Based on export control laws and regulations, MOFCOM issued two announcements in 2025:
- **Announcement No. 13** (March 4, 2025): Listed 15 U.S. entities
- **Announcement No. 21** (April 4, 2025): Listed 16 U.S. entities
- Combined total: 31 U.S. entities prohibited from receiving dual-use items exports

### Adjustment Measures
Effective November 10, 2025:

1. **Entities from Announcement No. 13 (15 entities)**:
   - Export control measures will be **discontinued**
   - Full lifting of export restrictions

2. **Entities from Announcement No. 21 (16 entities)**:
   - Export control measures will remain **suspended** for 1 additional year
   - Continuation of temporary suspension status

### Export License Application Process
- Exporters seeking to export dual-use items to the above entities must apply to MOFCOM
- Applications will be reviewed in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Export Control of Dual-Use Items" (中华人民共和国两用物项出口管制条例)
- Licenses will be granted if applications meet regulatory requirements

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: The following represents analytical assessment and does not constitute legal advice.**

### Positive Impacts
1. **Reduced Supply Chain Friction**: The lifting of controls on 15 entities and continued suspension for 16 entities signals regulatory relaxation, potentially restoring supply chains that were disrupted since March-April 2025.

2. **Trade Normalization**: This adjustment reflects improved bilateral trade relations following the Kuala Lumpur consultations, potentially encouraging further business engagement between Chinese exporters and U.S. technology companies.

3. **Predictability for Industry**: The one-year suspension period for the 16 entities provides planning certainty for affected companies and their Chinese suppliers.

### Considerations for Exporters
1. **License Application Timeline**: Companies should factor in the review and approval timeline when planning shipments to these entities.

2. **Differential Treatment**: The distinction between complete lifting (15 entities) and continued suspension (16 entities) suggests different risk assessments; exporters should monitor whether the 16 entities receive permanent relief after the one-year period.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Exporters must ensure strict compliance with the dual-use items export control regulations when applying for licenses, as approval is not automatic.
