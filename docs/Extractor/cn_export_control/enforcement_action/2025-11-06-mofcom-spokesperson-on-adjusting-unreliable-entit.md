## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce announced adjustments to its Unreliable Entity List measures targeting US entities, implementing the China-US Kuala Lumpur economic and trade consultation consensus. Starting from November 10, 2025, China will continue to suspend measures from the April 4 announcement for one year and completely cease measures from the March 4 announcements. Domestic enterprises may apply to conduct transactions with listed entities subject to approval.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM) / Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism
- **Effective Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Scope**: US entities previously listed on China's Unreliable Entity List; affects domestic Chinese enterprises seeking to transact with these entities

## Key Provisions

1. **Legal Basis**: The adjustment is made in accordance with the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China (《中华人民共和国反外国制裁法》) and the Provisions on Unreliable Entity List (《不可靠实体清单规定》).

2. **Background Measures**: The Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism issued announcements on March 4, 2025 and April 4, 2025, listing certain US entities on the Unreliable Entity List and imposing corresponding measures.

3. **Adjustment Details**:
   - **April 4 Announcement (No. 7, 2025)**: Measures will be suspended for one year starting November 10, 2025
   - **March 4 Announcements (No. 5 and 6, 2025)**: Measures will be completely ceased

4. **Transaction Application Process**: According to the Provisions on Unreliable Entity List, domestic enterprises may apply to conduct transactions with the above-mentioned entities. The Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism will review applications in accordance with the law and approve those meeting specified conditions.

5. **Policy Context**: This adjustment implements the consensus reached during China-US economic and trade consultations in Kuala Lumpur regarding the adjustment of non-tariff measures targeting the United States.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: This section represents analytical assessment and should not be construed as definitive predictions.**

**Potential Positive Impacts**:
- **Supply Chain Restoration**: Chinese enterprises in technology, aerospace, defense, and advanced manufacturing sectors may regain access to certain US suppliers or partners that were previously restricted
- **Business Continuity**: Companies that faced disruptions due to the entity list restrictions may resume normal procurement and partnership activities, subject to approval
- **Market Confidence**: The bilateral consultation outcome may signal improved China-US trade relations, potentially reducing uncertainty for businesses engaged in cross-border supply chains

**Remaining Considerations**:
- **Application-Based System**: Access to listed entities is not automatic but requires formal application and approval, which may create administrative delays
- **Selective Implementation**: The complete cessation of March 4 measures versus one-year suspension of April 4 measures suggests differentiated treatment, requiring businesses to carefully identify which entities fall under which category
- **Reciprocal Actions**: This measure is part of bilateral trade consensus; continued stability depends on corresponding US actions regarding Chinese entities
- **Compliance Burden**: Enterprises must navigate both the application process for transactions and ongoing compliance with China's export control regulations

**Affected Industries**:
- Technology and semiconductors
- Aerospace and aviation
- Defense and military-related industries
- Advanced manufacturing equipment
- Any sector involving previously listed US entities
