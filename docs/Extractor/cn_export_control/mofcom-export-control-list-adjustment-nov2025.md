## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce announced adjustments to export control measures targeting US entities following China-US trade negotiations in Kuala Lumpur. The adjustments include suspending measures against 15 entities and extending suspension for another 16 entities, with a new application process for dual-use item exports.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-10

**Scope:** 31 US entities previously subject to export control measures under Announcement No. 13 and Announcement No. 21

## Key Provisions

1. **Suspension of Announcement No. 13 Measures:** 15 US entities from Announcement No. 13 will have export control measures suspended starting November 10, 2025.

2. **Extension of Announcement No. 21 Suspensions:** 16 US entities from Announcement No. 21 will have their measures suspended for one additional year.

3. **Export Application Process:** Export operators seeking to export dual-use items (两用物项) to the affected entities must apply to the Ministry of Commerce in accordance with relevant regulations.

4. **Review and Approval:** Applications will be reviewed and approved based on compliance with dual-use export control regulations (依据两用物项出口管制相关规定审核并办理).

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Medium Impact (speculative):** The suspension of export control measures against 31 US entities creates new opportunities for Chinese exporters of dual-use items to resume business relationships. However, the requirement for application and approval introduces administrative procedures that may delay transactions. Companies should expect increased compliance documentation requirements and potential review periods. The one-year extension for 16 entities suggests ongoing evaluation of these entities' behavior and trade compliance. Chinese exporters should prepare comprehensive compliance packages demonstrating end-use verification and adherence to dual-use item regulations.

## Notes

This announcement is coordinated with the simultaneous adjustment to the Unreliable Entity List (Announcement 1187), representing a comprehensive de-escalation package following bilateral trade consultations. The distinction between entities under Announcement No. 13 and No. 21 suggests different risk profiles or original violation severities.
