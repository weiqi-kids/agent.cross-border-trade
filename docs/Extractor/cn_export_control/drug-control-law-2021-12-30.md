## Summary

The Drug Control Law of the PRC was enacted by the 31st Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress on December 29, 2007, and became effective on June 1, 2008. The law establishes comprehensive framework for drug control, covering prevention, prohibition, rehabilitation, and international cooperation.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2008-06-01
- **Scope**: Nationwide control of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and precursor chemicals; applies to all entities and individuals in China

## Key Provisions

**Definition and Scope**: The law defines drugs as substances that can cause addiction, including opium, heroin, methamphetamine (冰毒), and other narcotic/psychotropic substances.

**Basic Policy Framework**: Implements a comprehensive approach of "prevention first, comprehensive governance, and simultaneous prohibition of cultivation, manufacturing, trafficking, and consumption."

**Institutional Framework**: Establishes the National Narcotics Control Commission under unified government leadership with broad social participation.

**Public Education**: Mandates government agencies, schools, and media to conduct nationwide drug prevention education.

**Precursor Chemical Controls**: Implements a licensing system for production, operation, import and export of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and precursor chemicals.

**Rehabilitation Measures**: Establishes multi-tiered rehabilitation system including community-based rehabilitation, mandatory isolation rehabilitation (2-year term), and recovery treatment.

**Legal Liability**: Sets criminal and administrative penalties for smuggling, trafficking, manufacturing, and consumption of drugs.

**International Cooperation**: Defines framework for international drug control cooperation and intelligence sharing.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This law has significant implications for chemical and pharmaceutical supply chains operating in or with China:

1. **Precursor Chemical Trade**: Companies involved in chemicals listed as precursor substances must obtain licenses for production, trading, and import/export activities. This adds compliance burden and may delay shipments.

2. **Due Diligence Requirements**: Entities must verify end-users and end-uses to prevent diversion to drug manufacturing, increasing documentation and verification costs.

3. **Cross-border Movement**: Import/export of controlled chemicals requires advance approval, potentially impacting just-in-time supply chains for pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

4. **Compliance Risk**: Violations can result in criminal liability, creating high stakes for companies in chemical sectors.
