## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Technology Transfers**: Security reviews required for sensitive technology transfers and foreign investments
- **Data Flows**: Cybersecurity and information security provisions affect cross-border data transfers
- **Overseas Operations**: Chinese companies' overseas interests protected but also subject to state coordination
- **Supply Chain Security**: Economic and technological security provisions enable intervention in critical supply chains

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Technology Sector**: Intellectual property protection and cybersecurity requirements affect R&D cooperation
- **Financial Services**: Financial system security provisions affect banking operations and capital flows
- **Agriculture/Food**: Food security considerations may restrict agricultural exports or mandate domestic reserves
- **Energy**: Resource security provisions affect energy supply chain reliability requirements

### Strategic Considerations
