## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement 2025 No. 57, implementing export controls on five heavy rare earth elements (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium) and their related products, effective November 8, 2025. The controls apply to metals, alloys, oxides, target materials, and chemical compounds of these critical elements used in advanced technology and defense applications.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce & General Administration of Customs (商务部 & 海关总署)
- **Effective Date**: November 8, 2025
- **Scope**: Five heavy rare earth elements in all commercial forms

## Key Provisions

**Legal Basis:**
- Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China
- Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China
- Customs Law of the People's Republic of China
- Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- Approved by the State Council to maintain national security and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations

**Controlled Elements:**

**1. Holmium (1C909)**
- Metal forms and alloys (ingots, blocks, wires, powders, etc.)
- Target materials (sheets, tubes)
- Oxides and oxide mixtures
- Chemical compounds and mixtures

**2. Erbium (1C910)**
- Metal forms and alloys (various forms: ingots, blocks, wires, powders, etc.)
- Target materials (sheets, tubes)
- Oxides and oxide mixtures
- Chemical compounds and mixtures

**3. Thulium (1C911)**
- Metal forms and alloys (ingots, blocks, wires, powders, etc.)
- Target materials (sheets, tubes)
- Oxides and oxide mixtures
- Chemical compounds and mixtures

**4. Europium (1C912)**
- Metal forms and alloys (ingots, blocks, wires, powders, etc.)
- Target materials (sheets, tubes)
- Oxides and oxide mixtures
- Chemical compounds and mixtures

**5. Ytterbium (1C913)**
- Metal forms and alloys (ingots, blocks, wires, powders, etc.)
- Target materials (sheets, tubes)
- Oxides and oxide mixtures
- Chemical compounds and mixtures

**Compliance Requirements:**

Exporters must:
- Apply for permits per export control regulations
- Ensure accurate customs documentation
- Note whether items qualify as controlled dual-use products
- Indicate specific parameters if similar but uncontrolled

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Critical Applications:**

**Holmium:**
- High-power lasers (medical and military)
- Nuclear reactor control rods
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents
- Optical fiber amplifiers

**Erbium:**
- Fiber optic telecommunications (erbium-doped fiber amplifiers - EDFA)
- Laser systems (1550nm wavelength)
- Nuclear applications
- Metallurgical additives

**Thulium:**
- Portable X-ray sources
- Solid-state lasers
- Medical lasers (surgical applications)
- Radiation dosimeters

**Europium:**
- Phosphors for displays and lighting (red phosphor in LEDs, LCDs)
- Security features in currency and documents
- Nuclear reactor control materials
- Laser materials

**Ytterbium:**
- High-power fiber lasers (industrial cutting, military directed energy)
- Atomic clocks
- Quantum computing research
- Stress gauges and sensors

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **Telecommunications Infrastructure**: Erbium controls directly impact fiber optic network equipment (EDFAs are essential for long-haul fiber communications).

2. **Defense Systems**:
   - High-power lasers (ytterbium, holmium) for directed energy weapons
   - Targeting and rangefinding systems
   - Advanced optics and sensors
   - Nuclear applications (holmium, europium)

3. **Medical Technology**:
   - MRI systems (holmium)
   - Surgical lasers (thulium)
   - Medical imaging displays (europium phosphors)

4. **Advanced Manufacturing**:
   - Industrial fiber lasers (ytterbium) for metal cutting and welding
   - Display manufacturing (europium phosphors)

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:**

China controls approximately:
- 90%+ of global heavy rare earth production
- Southern China ion-adsorption deposits are the primary global source
- Processing capacity for separation and purification nearly 100%

**Market Impact:**

1. **Price Effects**: Licensing requirements will likely increase prices and reduce availability

2. **Supply Diversification Challenges**:
   - Limited non-Chinese sources (Vietnam has some deposits, U.S. Mountain Pass has minimal heavy REE content)
   - Long lead times to develop alternative sources (5-10 years)
   - High capital requirements for processing facilities

3. **Technology Substitution**:
   - Some applications may develop alternatives (but at performance cost)
   - Critical applications (fiber optics, high-power lasers) have no ready substitutes

4. **Stockpiling Likely**: Expectation of increased strategic stockpiling by major consuming countries

**Affected Industries by Element:**

- **Telecommunications**: Erbium (fiber optics)
- **Defense/Aerospace**: All five elements (lasers, sensors, nuclear)
- **Medical Devices**: Holmium, thulium, europium
- **Consumer Electronics**: Europium (displays)
- **Industrial Manufacturing**: Ytterbium (fiber lasers)
- **Quantum/Advanced Research**: Ytterbium, europium

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full announcement retrieved. This announcement specifically targets heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), which are more scarce and strategically valuable than light rare earths. The timing (October 9, 2025 announcement, November 8 effective date) aligns with companion announcements on rare earth production equipment (No. 56) and re-export controls (No. 61), creating a comprehensive control framework.

Heavy rare earths are disproportionately sourced from Southern China's unique ion-adsorption deposits, giving China near-monopoly control. The inclusion of "target materials" in the controlled forms is particularly significant, as these are used in semiconductor and display manufacturing via sputtering processes.

The announcement explicitly cites State Council approval and international non-proliferation obligations, suggesting this is viewed as a strategic control with national security implications, not merely an economic or environmental measure.
