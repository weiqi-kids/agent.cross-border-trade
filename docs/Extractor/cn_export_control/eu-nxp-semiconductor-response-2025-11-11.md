## Summary
China responded to European Commission trade official Šefčovič's statement on NXP semiconductors, asserting that the Netherlands bears responsibility for supply chain disruptions. China welcomed European efforts to influence the Netherlands to correct its measures and emphasized its exemption policy for civilian-use exports.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Scope**: EU-China-Netherlands trilateral coordination on semiconductor supply chain

## Key Provisions
- China asserted "source and responsibility for current global semiconductor supply chain disruptions lies with the Netherlands"
- Noted Europe indicated it would work with the Netherlands
- Urged stronger European efforts to "promote the Netherlands to quickly withdraw relevant measures"
- Emphasized China has taken compliance measures to exempt civilian-use-related exports
- Welcomed European efforts to influence Netherlands to "correct erroneous practices" promptly

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Multilateral Engagement**: China's engagement with the EU as a mediator adds a new dimension to the Netherlands dispute. The EU's potential influence on Netherlands policy could accelerate resolution. China's exemption for civilian-use exports provides partial supply chain continuity, but full resolution depends on Netherlands withdrawing administrative measures. This trilateral dynamic may offer more pathways to de-escalation than bilateral negotiations alone.
