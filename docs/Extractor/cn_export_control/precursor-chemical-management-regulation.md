## Summary
This comprehensive regulation establishes a classified management and licensing system for precursor chemicals used in drug manufacturing, containing 45 articles across 8 chapters that govern production, operation, purchase, transport, and import/export activities. The regulation has been revised three times since its original 2005 issuance to strengthen controls and enforcement mechanisms.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2005-08-26 (original); revised 2014-07-29, 2016-02-06, 2018-09-18
- **Scope**: All entities and individuals involved in production, operation, purchase, transport, or import/export of precursor chemicals within China

## Key Provisions
- **Classified Management System**: Category I substances require explicit licensing; Categories II and III require notification/registration before operations
- **Licensing Requirements**: Prohibits unlicensed production and trafficking of controlled precursor chemicals
- **Approval Procedures**: Coordination through relevant government departments including pharmacy administration, public security, and customs
- **Record-Keeping Mandates**: Enterprises must maintain detailed records of all transactions involving precursor chemicals
- **Reporting Requirements**: Mandatory reporting to oversight authorities for specified activities and thresholds
- **Multi-Agency Oversight**: Involves pharmacy, public security, customs, and other relevant departments in enforcement
- **Transport Controls**: Special requirements for transportation of precursor chemicals
- **Penalty Framework**: Enforcement mechanisms for violations across the supply chain

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This assessment represents speculative analysis based on regulatory framework:*

International companies sourcing chemicals from China should expect enhanced scrutiny for any substances potentially classifiable as precursor chemicals. The multi-agency approval process may create bottlenecks, particularly for Category I substances requiring explicit licensing. Companies in pharmaceutical, chemical manufacturing, and industrial sectors should conduct thorough classification reviews of imported materials and maintain detailed audit trails. The regulation's multiple revisions suggest an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with potential for future scope expansion. Supply chain professionals should anticipate 3-6 week additional lead times for initial transactions involving these substances and consider diversifying supplier bases across multiple jurisdictions.
