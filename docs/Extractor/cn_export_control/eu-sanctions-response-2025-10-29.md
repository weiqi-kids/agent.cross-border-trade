## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a formal statement opposing the European Union's decision to include Chinese companies in its 19th sanctions package against Russia, marking the first time the EU sanctioned major Chinese oil refineries and petroleum traders. China expressed strong dissatisfaction, stating the EU disregarded repeated Chinese appeals and proceeded unilaterally, rejecting sanctions lacking international legal basis and warning of negative impacts on bilateral economic cooperation and global energy security.

- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-29 (EU's 19th sanctions round)
- **Scope**: Chinese companies including major oil refineries and petroleum traders—first time EU sanctioned such entities

## Key Provisions
- **Strong Dissatisfaction**: "The EU disregarded repeated Chinese appeals and proceeded unilaterally" (欧盟不顾中方多次交涉和劝阻,一意孤行)
- **Legal Rejection**: China rejects unilateral sanctions lacking international legal basis or UN Security Council authorization
- **Diplomatic Critique**: Actions contradict EU-China leadership consensus and harm bilateral economic cooperation
- **Energy Security Warning**: Sanctions threaten global energy security
- **China's Demand**: Urges EU to immediately cease targeting Chinese businesses
- **Countermeasures**: Beijing indicates it would take necessary countermeasures to protect Chinese enterprises' legitimate interests and safeguard national energy security
- **Historic Significance**: First time EU sanctioned major Chinese oil refineries and petroleum traders

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
The EU's unprecedented inclusion of major Chinese oil refineries and petroleum traders in Russia sanctions represents a significant escalation in Western secondary sanctions enforcement. This directly targets critical nodes in China-Russia energy trade—a cornerstone of bilateral economic relations representing billions in annual transactions. Chinese refineries sanctioned by the EU face potential restrictions accessing European financial systems, insurance, shipping services, and technology providers, forcing them to choose between European market access and Russian oil imports. The energy security warning signals China may retaliate by restricting critical mineral or component exports to Europe. Global energy supply chains face increased fragmentation as China-Russia energy infrastructure becomes increasingly isolated from Western-aligned markets.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This represents the most significant EU sanctions action targeting China to date, moving beyond component suppliers to core energy infrastructure operators. The strong diplomatic language and energy security warning suggest China views this as crossing a red line that may trigger substantive countermeasures. The article does not specify which refineries and traders were sanctioned.
