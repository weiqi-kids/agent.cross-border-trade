## Summary

On September 5, 2024, the US Bureau of Industry and Security issued a temporary final rule establishing export controls on critical and emerging technologies, specifically quantum computing and advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The regulation became effective September 6, 2024, and notably includes license exceptions for international partners covered by broad technology agreements with the United States. A 60-day public comment period was opened.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
- **Effective Date:** 2024-09-06
- **Scope:** Critical and emerging technologies including quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing equipment

## Key Provisions

1. **New Export Controls:** Establishes controls on quantum computing technologies and semiconductor manufacturing equipment
2. **Temporary Final Rule:** Rule effective immediately with 60-day public comment period (concludes approximately November 5, 2024)
3. **License Exceptions for Partners:** Countries covered by "broad technology agreements" with the US receive license exceptions — likely includes close allies and partners under existing frameworks
4. **Technology Focus:** Targets critical and emerging technologies with national security implications

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment (speculative)

**Affected Sectors:** Quantum computing, advanced semiconductor manufacturing, photonics, specialized materials, precision equipment

**Potential Supply Chain Effects:**
- US exporters of quantum and advanced semiconductor equipment must obtain licenses unless partner country qualifies for exception
- Non-partner countries (likely including China, Russia) face stricter licensing requirements for these technologies
- Technology transfer and collaboration in quantum computing may be restricted to alliance partners
- Semiconductor equipment manufacturers may need to restructure supply chains based on destination countries
- R&D partnerships and academic exchanges involving these technologies may require export compliance review

**Geographic Scope:**
- **Partner Countries (likely license-eligible):** Traditional US allies (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Netherlands, EU members, Australia, UK, Canada) — based on existing export control cooperation frameworks
- **Restricted Destinations (likely subject to full licensing):** China, Russia, entities on Entity List

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Exporters should verify whether destination country qualifies for license exceptions
- "Broad technology agreements" likely reference multilateral arrangements (Wassenaar Arrangement) or bilateral agreements
- Temporary nature suggests possible revisions based on public comments
