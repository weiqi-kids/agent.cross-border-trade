## Summary

The Nuclear Export Control Regulation was originally promulgated by the State Council on September 10, 1997 (Order No. 230) and revised on November 9, 2006. The regulation establishes a comprehensive framework to strengthen nuclear export controls, prevent nuclear weapons proliferation, and guard against nuclear terrorism.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 1997-09-10 (original), 2006-11-09 (revision)
- **Scope**: Applies to all nuclear exports from China, with particular restrictions on sensitive facilities including uranium enrichment, reprocessing, and heavy water production facilities

## Key Provisions

**Nuclear Export Monopoly System**: Nuclear exports are subject to a state monopoly system, with only entities designated by the State Council authorized to conduct nuclear export business.

**Strict Restrictions on Sensitive Items**: Particularly stringent controls apply to:
- Uranium enrichment facilities and equipment
- Reprocessing facilities and equipment
- Heavy water production facilities
- Related technologies and materials

**Documentation Requirements**: Export applications must include:
- End-user certificate
- Recipient government guarantees
- Technical specifications
- Contract terms
- Intended use verification

**Approval Process**:
1. China Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA) conducts initial review (15 working days)
2. Relevant departments conduct secondary review (15 working days)
3. Ministry of Commerce issues export license

**Key Guarantee Requirements**: Recipients must pledge:
- Not to use items for nuclear explosive purposes
- Implement physical protection measures
- Maintain IAEA safeguards agreements

**Legal Liability**:
- Violations regarding export control list items: fines of 1-5 times the illegal transaction value, with minimum RMB 50,000
- Forging or altering licenses: criminal prosecution if crime is constituted
- Other violations: handled according to relevant laws and regulations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

This regulation has significant implications for nuclear and related industries:

1. **Market Access Barriers**: The state monopoly system limits nuclear trade to government-designated entities, creating high barriers to market entry for private companies.

2. **Extended Lead Times**: The two-stage approval process (CAEA initial review + multi-agency secondary review) requires at least 30 working days, plus additional time for documentation preparation and final license issuance. Nuclear supply chains must account for 2-3 month lead times for regulatory approvals.

3. **Technology Transfer Restrictions**: Stringent controls on sensitive nuclear technologies (enrichment, reprocessing, heavy water production) effectively limit technology transfer and may push recipients toward alternative suppliers or indigenous development.

4. **Compliance Costs**: End-user verification, government guarantee procurement, and IAEA safeguards compliance create substantial administrative and legal costs for nuclear exporters and importers.

5. **Geopolitical Constraints**: The requirement for recipient government guarantees and IAEA safeguards agreements means nuclear exports are feasible only with countries maintaining specific international commitments, excluding certain markets.

6. **Sector-Specific Impact**:
   - **Nuclear Power Industry**: Power plant construction projects involving Chinese suppliers must factor in extended licensing timelines
   - **Nuclear Medicine**: Medical isotope suppliers face similar controls, potentially affecting healthcare supply chains
   - **Research Institutions**: University and research laboratory collaborations involving nuclear materials require government-level coordination

Content retrieved via WebFetch. This is a foundational regulation from 1997 (revised 2006), republished on the MOFCOM export control website on 2021-12-30 as part of consolidated regulatory documentation. **Important context**: This regulation was among those repealed by the new unified Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items (State Council Order No. 792) effective December 1, 2024. Nuclear dual-use items are now governed by the consolidated framework.
