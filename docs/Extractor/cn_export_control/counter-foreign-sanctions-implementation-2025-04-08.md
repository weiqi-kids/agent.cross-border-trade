## Summary
China's Counter-Foreign Sanctions Implementation Provisions establish operational procedures for imposing counter-measures against foreign entities that discriminate against Chinese citizens/organizations, interfere in internal affairs, or threaten China's sovereignty and interests. The 22-article regulation authorizes visa/entry controls, asset freezing/confiscation, and trade/investment restrictions. Sanctioned entities may appeal by demonstrating behavioral correction.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: Upon publication (自公布之日起施行) - 2025-04-08
- **Scope**: Foreign entities and individuals imposing discriminatory restrictions on China or Chinese interests
- **Legal Basis**: Implements the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law

## Key Provisions

### Triggering Conditions
Counter-sanctions may be imposed against foreign entities that:
- Impose discriminatory restrictions on Chinese citizens or organizations
- Interfere in China's internal affairs
- Threaten China's sovereignty, security, or development interests
- Participate in or support foreign sanctions against China

### Visa and Entry Controls (Article 6)
- **Visa Denial**: Authorities may refuse to issue visas to sanctioned individuals
- **Entry Prevention**: Can prevent entry into Chinese territory
- **Deportation**: Can deport individuals already in China
- **Travel Restrictions**: Comprehensive movement controls

### Asset Restrictions (Article 7)
Authorities can impose the following measures on sanctioned entities:
- **Freeze**: Temporarily restrict access to assets
- **Seize**: Take possession of assets
- **Confiscate**: Permanently acquire ownership

**Asset Categories**:
- Financial assets (bank accounts, securities, etc.)
- Equity stakes in companies
- Intellectual property rights
- Real property and physical assets

### Trade and Activity Limitations (Articles 8-9)
Restrictions on transactions in multiple sectors:
- **Education**: Academic exchanges, student enrollment
- **Technology**: Technology transfers, technical cooperation
- **Commerce**: Import/export transactions, procurement
- **Investment**: Foreign direct investment, portfolio investment

**Export Prohibitions**: Controlled materials and technologies cannot be exported to sanctioned entities

### Appeal Process (Article 14)
- **Request Mechanism**: Sanctioned entities may request suspension or cancellation of measures
- **Evidence Requirement**: Must provide evidence of behavioral correction
- **Discretionary Review**: Authorities evaluate whether sanctioning conditions no longer exist
- **Administrative Remedy**: Provides limited recourse for affected parties

### Administrative Coordination
Multi-agency implementation:
- **Foreign Affairs**: Diplomatic aspects and visa/entry controls
- **Commerce Ministry**: Trade and investment restrictions
- **Customs**: Export/import enforcement
- **Immigration**: Entry/exit controls
- **Coordinated Mechanisms**: Established inter-agency coordination procedures

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Affects foreign companies with operations in China, Chinese subsidiaries of foreign parent companies, joint ventures, supply chain partners, and financial institutions.

**Impact on Supply Chains**:
- **Asset Seizure Risk**: Foreign entities' Chinese assets (factories, inventory, IP, bank accounts) subject to confiscation
- **Trade Disruption**: Export prohibitions can sever critical supply chains for sanctioned entities
- **Investment Uncertainty**: Equity stakes in Chinese joint ventures at risk of freezing or confiscation
- **Personnel Restrictions**: Visa denials and deportations disrupt business operations and management
- **Third-Party Risk**: Chinese companies may be prohibited from transacting with sanctioned foreign entities
- **IP Vulnerability**: Intellectual property rights in China subject to confiscation creates technology exposure
- **Financial Isolation**: Banking restrictions can freeze operational capital and payments

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Reciprocal Measures**: Designed to counter Western sanctions (US, EU, etc.) with equivalent Chinese measures
- **Extraterritorial Implications**: Chinese entities may be required to cease business with sanctioned foreign companies globally
- **Behavioral Compliance**: Appeal mechanism suggests measures are reversible if entities change behavior
- **Political Risk**: Sanctions triggered by political/policy decisions, not commercial disputes
- **Due Diligence Gap**: Unlike Western sanctions lists (OFAC, EU), counter-sanctions may have limited advance notice
- **Secondary Sanctions Risk**: Chinese companies face dilemma of complying with Chinese counter-sanctions vs. Western sanctions
- **Jurisdictional Conflict**: Creates compliance conflicts for multinational companies subject to both Western and Chinese sanctions

**Comparative Analysis**:
- Mirrors Western sanctions architecture (asset freezes, trade restrictions, visa bans)
- Broader scope including "interference in internal affairs" as trigger
- Includes IP confiscation - less common in Western sanctions regimes
- Appeal mechanism provides flexibility compared to rigid Western sanctions lists

## Notes
WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content. This regulation is particularly significant as it operationalizes China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, creating a comprehensive framework for reciprocal sanctions. The inclusion of IP confiscation is notable and creates unique risks for technology companies. The timing (2025-04-08) indicates this is recent guidance implementing the 2021 Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law. Companies operating in both China and Western jurisdictions face complex compliance dilemmas when entities are subject to both Western sanctions and Chinese counter-sanctions. The behavioral correction appeal mechanism suggests China views these measures as policy tools rather than permanent designations.
