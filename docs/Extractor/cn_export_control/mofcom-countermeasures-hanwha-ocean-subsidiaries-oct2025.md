## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce announced countermeasures against five US subsidiary companies of Korea's Hanwha Ocean Corporation in response to US Section 301 measures targeting China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. The subsidiaries have been added to China's countermeasures list, prohibiting Chinese organizations and individuals from conducting transactions with these entities.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15 (announcement date; implementation date likely immediate or shortly thereafter)

**Scope:** Five US-related subsidiary companies of Hanwha Ocean Corporation (韩华海洋株式会社)

## Key Provisions

1. **Addition to Countermeasures List:** Five US subsidiary companies of Hanwha Ocean Corporation have been "added to the countermeasures list" (列入反制清单).

2. **Transaction Prohibition:** Chinese "organizations and individuals" are prohibited from "conducting relevant transactions and cooperation" (进行相关交易和合作) with the listed entities.

3. **Legal Authority:** Actions were taken pursuant to the "Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China" (反外国制裁法) and approved by the State Council's counter-sanctions coordination mechanism.

4. **Triggering Event:** The countermeasures respond to US implementation of "final measures regarding a Section 301 investigation into China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors" on October 14, 2025, which China characterizes as violating international law.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High Impact (speculative):** The prohibition on transactions with Hanwha Ocean's US subsidiaries creates significant disruptions in the global shipbuilding supply chain. Hanwha Ocean is a major global shipbuilder, and its US subsidiaries likely provide specialized components, technology, or services to the parent company's operations. Chinese suppliers of shipbuilding materials, components, and services must immediately cease business with the five listed subsidiaries. This may disrupt production schedules for vessels under construction and force Hanwha Ocean to restructure its supply chain away from Chinese sources. Companies in the maritime equipment, ship components, and marine technology sectors should assess their exposure to both Hanwha Ocean and its US subsidiaries.

## Notes

This enforcement action represents China's use of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law as a retaliatory tool against US trade measures. The targeting of a South Korean company's US subsidiaries (rather than the Korean parent) demonstrates China's strategy of imposing costs on US-linked entities while potentially preserving relations with the Korean parent company. The specific identity of the five subsidiaries should be obtained from MOFCOM's official countermeasures list for compliance purposes.
