## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce added three American entities to its export control management list to safeguard national security and fulfill non-proliferation obligations under international agreements. Export operators are prohibited from exporting dual-use items to these entities, with violations subject to legal consequences under the Export Control Law and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (商务部)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Scope**: Three unspecified U.S. entities deemed harmful to China's national security and interests

## Key Provisions
- **Legal Basis**: Export Control Law and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- **Prohibition**: Export operators are forbidden from exporting dual-use items to the three listed entities
- **Justification**: Entities are "harmful to China's national security and interests"
- **Enforcement**: Violations subject to legal consequences under applicable regulations
- **International Obligation**: Action taken to fulfill non-proliferation commitments under international agreements

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
This enforcement action creates immediate compliance obligations for Chinese exporters dealing with dual-use items. Companies must screen these three U.S. entities and cease any ongoing transactions involving controlled dual-use technologies or materials. The measure represents China's reciprocal enforcement mechanism in response to similar U.S. restrictions, contributing to increasing bifurcation in technology supply chains between the two countries.
