## Summary

Switzerland's Federal Council tasked the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, Education and Research to submit a proposal by end of 2025 to transfer relevant dual-use items into existing commodity control lists, ensuring alignment with international standards for emerging technologies.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Swiss Federal Council / State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
- **Effective Date:** Proposal deadline: end of 2025; final implementation date to be determined
- **Scope:** Dual-use items in emerging technology sectors requiring updated export control oversight; alignment with international export control mechanisms

## Key Provisions

1. **Proposal Mandate**: State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, Education and Research directed to develop proposal by December 31, 2025
2. **Control List Integration**: Transfer relevant dual-use items into existing commodity control lists (Güterkontrollverordnung)
3. **International Alignment Objective**: Ensure Switzerland's export controls align with international standards and multilateral export control regimes
4. **Emerging Technology Coverage**: Address new and future technological developments to maintain comprehensive export control oversight
5. **Geopolitical Context**: Recognizes that geopolitical tensions have affected dual-use export management in emerging technology sectors across multiple nations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Swiss Technology Exporters**: Emerging technology sectors (likely quantum, AI, advanced semiconductors) will face new licensing requirements once controls are implemented, potentially affecting time-to-market for Swiss exporters
- **International Competitiveness**: Alignment with international standards suggests coordination with EU, Wassenaar Arrangement, and other multilateral frameworks, maintaining Swiss exporters' access to allied markets
- **Compliance Timeline**: 12+ month proposal development period provides industry time to prepare for new controls, but creates regulatory uncertainty during transition
- **Dual-Use Technology Focus**: Controls likely target areas where Switzerland has advanced capabilities (precision manufacturing, photonics, advanced materials, semiconductor equipment), potentially affecting exports to non-allied markets
- **Neutrality Considerations**: Switzerland's traditional neutrality balanced against participation in international technology control regimes; may affect positioning in global technology supply chains

## Notes

Article notes that Switzerland and other countries participating in international export control mechanisms have agreed to or already updated control measures in response to technological advancement. The 2025 proposal deadline indicates implementation likely in 2026 or later. This represents Switzerland's response to global trend of tightening controls on emerging/critical technologies.
