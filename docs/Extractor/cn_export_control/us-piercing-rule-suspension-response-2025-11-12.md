## Summary
China welcomed the US announcement on November 10, 2025, to suspend the export control piercing rule for one year. This prevents affiliated enterprises with over 50% ownership by Entity List entities from facing additional sanctions. China characterized this as implementing the China-US Kuala Lumpur consultations consensus.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-10 to 2026-11-09
- **Scope**: US export controls on affiliates of Entity List companies

## Key Provisions
- US announced moratorium from November 10, 2025 to November 9, 2026
- During suspension period, affiliated enterprises with over 50% ownership stakes held by US Entity List entities will not face additional sanctions via piercing rule
- China characterized this as "important measure implementing consensus" from China-US Kuala Lumpur consultations
- Both parties indicated they "will continue discussing this arrangement" regarding renewal after one year
- China expressed willingness to engage in dialogue, strengthen communication, and manage differences

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Major Relief for Corporate Structures**: The piercing rule suspension significantly reduces compliance burden for multinational corporations with Chinese affiliates or subsidiaries of Entity List companies. This enables more normal business operations for entities like SMIC affiliates, Huawei subsidiaries, and other complex corporate structures. The one-year duration creates planning uncertainty, but the commitment to ongoing discussions suggests potential extension. Companies should use this period to restructure supply chains and prepare for possible rule reinstatement in November 2026.
