## Summary
The Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement 2024 No. 33, implementing export controls on antimony-related products and superhard materials equipment effective September 15, 2024. The regulation controls antimony ores, metals, high-purity oxides, organic compounds, gold-antimony metallurgical separation technology, hexahedral press machines, MPCVD equipment for diamond synthesis, and related manufacturing technologies to protect national security and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs
- **Effective Date**: 2024-09-15

- End-user certifications
- Identification documents

**Approval Authority:**
- Ministry of Commerce processes applications within statutory timeframes
- Comprehensive review of end-user and end-use
- State Council approval for exports significantly impacting national security

**Enforcement:**
- Unauthorized exports face administrative penalties
- Potential criminal liability under Chinese law
- Customs verification of export licenses at ports

**Legal Basis:**
- Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China
- National security protection
- International non-proliferation obligations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Critical Materials and Technologies:**
- **Antimony:** China produces approximately 50% of global antimony supply; controls affect flame retardants, batteries, and military applications
- **Superhard Materials Equipment:** Restricts access to industrial diamond and cubic boron nitride manufacturing technology
- **High-Purity Compounds:** Semiconductor and optoelectronics applications requiring ultra-pure antimony compounds

**Industry Sectors Affected:**

*Antimony Supply Chains:*
- **Defense:** Ammunition, infrared sensors, and night vision devices using antimony compounds
- **Flame Retardants:** Plastics, textiles, and electronics requiring antimony trioxide
- **Batteries:** Lead-acid battery manufacturers using antimony alloys
- **Semiconductors:** Indium antimonide for infrared detectors and high-speed electronics

*Superhard Materials:*
- **Manufacturing:** Cutting tools, grinding wheels, and wear-resistant components using industrial diamonds
- **Electronics:** Heat sinks and thermal management using synthetic diamond materials
- **Optics:** High-power laser windows and infrared optics requiring diamond windows
- **Research:** High-pressure materials science and quantum research using superhard materials

**International Trade Impact:**
- Alternative antimony sources (Russia, Tajikistan, Myanmar) face capacity and quality constraints
- Superhard materials equipment from Western suppliers (U.S., Europe) limited by export controls
- Lead-acid battery manufacturers globally dependent on antimony alloys face supply risks
- Electronics thermal management supply chains require alternative materials or Chinese export licenses

**Strategic Implications:**
- Strengthens China's control over critical antimony supply chain (50% global production)
- Protects advanced superhard materials manufacturing technology
- Limits foreign access to high-pressure synthesis equipment
- Supports domestic superhard materials industry development
- Addresses military and dual-use applications of antimony in defense systems

**Compliance Timeline:**
- Approximately 20 days from announcement (August 15, 2024) to effective date (September 15, 2024)
- Short compliance window requires rapid contract review and permit applications
- Existing shipments in transit may face retroactive permit requirements

**Technology Transfer Restrictions:**
- Gold-antimony metallurgical separation technology control limits mining sector knowledge transfer
- MPCVD equipment restrictions protect synthetic diamond manufacturing capabilities
- Hexahedral press technology controls safeguard high-pressure materials science advantages

## Notes
WebFetch successful - full policy content retrieved. This announcement issued August 15, 2024, represents a strategic expansion of China's critical mineral export controls, paralleling earlier controls on gallium, germanium, and graphite. The antimony controls are particularly significant given China's dominant 50% share of global production and limited alternative sources. The superhard materials equipment controls protect China's technological leadership in industrial diamond and cubic boron nitride manufacturing, which are essential for advanced manufacturing and defense applications. The simultaneous control of both raw antimony materials and high-purity compounds ensures comprehensive supply chain coverage from mining through advanced processing.
