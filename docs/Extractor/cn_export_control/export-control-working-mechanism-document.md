- The prohibition on data transmission may affect ongoing research collaborations, joint development programs, and information sharing arrangements

**Geographic Scope** (speculative):
The TechInsights listing includes its entire global network across Canada, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States, indicating a comprehensive approach to blocking access to its semiconductor analysis capabilities regardless of operational jurisdiction.
