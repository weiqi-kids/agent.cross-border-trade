## Summary
China's Biological Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations established controls to prevent biological materials, equipment, and technology from supporting weapons development. The regulations required exporter registration, prior licensing approval with differentiated timelines (15 days for Category 1, 45 days for Category 2), and recipient guarantees against weapons use and diversion. This regulation has been repealed and superseded by more recent legislation.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (Order No. 365)
- **Effective Date**: December 1, 2002
- **Scope**: Biological dual-use materials, related equipment, and technology with potential weapons applications
- **Status**: [已废止] Repealed - superseded by later regulations

## Key Provisions

### Purpose
- Prevent biological dual-use materials from supporting weapons development
- Protect national security
- Implement international non-proliferation commitments

### Registration and Licensing
- **Mandatory Registration**: Exporters must register with Ministry of Commerce's foreign trade authority before conducting business in controlled items
- **Prior Licensing**: All exports require approval before execution
- **Differentiated Timelines**:
  - Category 1 items: 15 working days review period
  - Category 2 items: 45 working days review period
- **No Unauthorized Exports**: Strict prohibition on exports without licenses

### Recipient Guarantees
Recipients must provide guarantees that:
- Items won't support biological weapons purposes
- Items won't be diverted from stated end-use
- Items won't be transferred to unauthorized third parties

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Criminal Penalties**: Unauthorized exports subject to smuggling charges
- **Administrative Fines**: 50,000 to 250,000 yuan for less severe violations
- **Tiered Penalty Structure**: Severity-based enforcement approach

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Affected life sciences, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, laboratory equipment, and research sectors dealing with pathogens, toxins, fermentation equipment, biosafety equipment, and related technologies.

**Impact on Supply Chains** (Historical Context):
- **Dual Category System**: Different review timelines created predictability challenges for supply planning
- **Registration Barrier**: Pre-registration requirement limited market participation
- **End-Use Verification**: Guarantee requirements created compliance burden for both exporters and importers
- **Biosecurity Focus**: Controls targeted Biological Weapons Convention concerns
- **Research Restrictions**: Academic and commercial research collaborations required export licenses
- **Equipment Controls**: Biosafety cabinets, fermenters, and specialized laboratory equipment subject to controls

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Repealed Status**: This regulation is no longer in effect, likely superseded by the 2020 Export Control Law and its implementing regulations
- **Framework Precedent**: The two-category system and differentiated review timelines likely influenced successor regulations
- **Biosecurity Evolution**: Reflects earlier stage of China's export control regime development
- **Current Applicability**: Substantive controls on biological dual-use items continue under newer legal framework
- **International Alignment**: Original regulation aligned with Australia Group export control standards

## Notes
WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content. **IMPORTANT**: This regulation has been officially repealed [已废止]. While the specific regulation is no longer in effect, biological dual-use export controls remain in force under the 2020 Export Control Law and its implementing regulations. The two-category classification system and recipient guarantee requirements established by this regulation have been incorporated into the current legal framework. Users should consult current regulations for applicable requirements.
