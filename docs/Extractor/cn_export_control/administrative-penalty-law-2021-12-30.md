## Summary
China's Administrative Penalty Law establishes comprehensive procedural framework for government agencies to impose penalties, defining penalty types, jurisdictional authority, decision procedures (simplified, ordinary, and hearing), and enforcement mechanisms. The law grants regulated parties statement and defense rights and requires penalties to be proportionate to violations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee
- **Effective Date**: 2021-07-15
- **Scope**: All administrative penalties imposed by government agencies; procedural protections for regulated parties

## Key Provisions

### Eight-Chapter Structure

**Chapter 1 - General Provisions**
- Defines administrative penalties as "measures that reduce rights or increase obligations"
- Establishes fundamental principles:
  - Legality: penalties must have legal basis
  - Proportionality: penalties must match violation severity
  - Fair procedures: notice, opportunity to be heard, and right to review
- Statute of limitations: two years from violation date (extended to five years for certain violations)

**Chapter 2 - Types and Authority to Set Penalties**
Penalty types include:
- Warnings and reprimands
- Fines
- Confiscation of illegal gains and contraband
- Suspension or revocation of licenses/permits
- Administrative detention
- Other penalties prescribed by law

Authority hierarchy:
- National laws may establish all penalty types
- Administrative regulations may establish warnings, fines, and confiscation
- Local regulations have limited penalty-setting authority

**Chapter 3 - Implementing Agencies**
- Specifies which government bodies have enforcement authority
- Requires clear delegation for collaborative enforcement
- Prohibits agencies from exceeding jurisdictional authority

**Chapter 4 - Jurisdiction and Application**
- Geographic jurisdiction: location of violation
- Substantive jurisdiction: agency's regulatory scope
- Concurrent jurisdiction: coordination among multiple agencies
- Prohibits double punishment for same violation

**Chapter 5 - Decision Procedures**
Three procedural tracks:

1. **Simplified Procedure**: For minor violations with fixed penalties; on-site decision possible
2. **Ordinary Procedure**: For most violations:
   - Investigation and evidence collection
   - Notice to violator with opportunity for statement and defense
   - Agency review and decision
   - Written penalty decision with reasoning
3. **Hearing Procedure**: Required for:
   - Large fines (thresholds specified)
   - License revocations
   - Other significant penalties

**Chapter 6 - Enforcement**
- Payment methods and deadlines
- Consequences for non-payment (late fees, asset seizure)
- Prohibition on private settlement or fee reduction by officials

**Chapter 7 - Legal Liability**
- Administrative penalties for officials who:
  - Impose penalties without legal authority
  - Fail to follow procedures
  - Accept bribes or engage in corruption
  - Abuse enforcement powers
- Range from warnings to dismissal from office

**Chapter 8 - Supplementary Provisions**
- Technical definitions
- References to other laws (criminal, civil)
- Effective date

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Due Process Rights**: Companies subject to penalties have rights to statement, defense, and hearing
- **Procedural Predictability**: Three-tier procedure system creates clear expectations for penalty processes
- **Fine Calculation**: Proportionality requirement prevents arbitrary or excessive fines
- **Statute of Limitations**: Two-year limitation (five years for certain violations) provides certainty

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Export Control Compliance**: Export control violations subject to administrative penalties under Export Control Law, with procedures governed by this law
- **Customs/Trade**: Trade violations processed through customs administrative penalty procedures
- **Financial Services**: Regulatory penalties must follow procedural requirements
- **Environmental/Safety**: Industrial violations subject to notice, hearing, and proportionality requirements

### Strategic Considerations
- Hearing procedure requirement for large fines provides opportunity to present mitigating circumstances
- Statement and defense rights enable companies to explain compliance efforts or unintentional violations
- Proportionality principle may reduce penalties for first-time or minor violations
- Statute of limitations prevents indefinite enforcement risk
- Prohibition on double punishment protects against multiple agencies penalizing same conduct
