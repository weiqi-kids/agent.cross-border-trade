- **Impact**: Tightens control on materials for sub-3nm chip production
- **Alignment**: Coordinates with U.S. and Netherlands semiconductor equipment controls

**Stealth and Defense Technologies:**
- **Infrared absorbing materials**: Expands radar stealth controls to include thermal signature reduction
- **Composite ceramic coatings**: Protects hypersonic and high-temperature aerospace technologies
- **Impact**: Defense contractors and aerospace suppliers face enhanced licensing requirements

**Additive Manufacturing:**
- **Lamination molding equipment**: Targets metal 3D printing for aerospace components
- **Impact**: Restricts access to advanced manufacturing capabilities for strategic applications

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Coordinates with allied nations on emerging technology controls
- Implements Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral export control updates
- Reflects Japan's role in global technology supply chains requiring strategic oversight

**Affected Industries:**
- Quantum computing research and development
- Semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials
- Aerospace and defense
- Advanced materials and specialty chemicals
- Additive manufacturing

**Compliance Timeline:**
- ~2 month implementation window (May 25, 2025)
- Companies should conduct gap analysis and update compliance systems
- Existing contracts may require renegotiation for licensed items

## Notes
- Article successfully fetched via WebFetch
- This represents one of Japan's most comprehensive export control updates for emerging technologies
- Multiple amendments target quantum computing, reflecting strategic importance and international coordination
- Semiconductor precursor controls complement equipment controls already in place
- Heavy water → water revision requires further clarification from METI
- Companies affected should monitor METI ministerial ordinances for technical specifications
- Two-month implementation period is relatively short for major supply chain adjustments
