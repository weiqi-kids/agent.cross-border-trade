## Summary
China's Export Control Law establishes a unified export control system for dual-use items, military products, nuclear materials, and related technologies. The law implements control lists, licensing procedures, and enforcement mechanisms with substantial penalties for violations, while authorizing international cooperation and reciprocal sanctions.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2020-12-01
- **Scope**: Dual-use items, military products, nuclear materials, and related goods/technologies/services affecting national security or weapons proliferation prevention

## Key Provisions

### Control Mechanism
- Unified export control system through control lists and licensing procedures
- Definition of dual-use items: goods with civilian and military applications, particularly those enabling weapons of mass destruction design, development, production, or use

### Export Requirements
- Exporters must obtain licenses from relevant authorities
- Provision of end-user certificates mandatory
- Compliance with final-use restrictions
- Government assessment of target countries' risk levels

### Enforcement Powers
- Authorities may conduct inspections and freeze assets

### International Cooperation
- Authorization to participate in international export control frameworks
- Reciprocal sanctions against nations abusing control measures

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Export Licensing**: All controlled items require pre-approval, adding 30-90 days to transaction timelines
- **Compliance Costs**: Companies must establish internal compliance programs, end-user verification systems, and recordkeeping infrastructure
- **Restricted Party Screening**: Mandatory screening against Chinese restricted entity lists before transactions

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Technology Sector**: Semiconductors, AI chips, encryption technology subject to enhanced scrutiny
- **Aerospace/Defense**: Dual-use materials and components face stringent controls
- **Chemical Industry**: Precursor chemicals for weapons applications require special licenses

### Strategic Considerations
- Reciprocal sanctions provision enables countermeasures against foreign restrictions
- End-use certificate requirements increase supply chain transparency obligations
