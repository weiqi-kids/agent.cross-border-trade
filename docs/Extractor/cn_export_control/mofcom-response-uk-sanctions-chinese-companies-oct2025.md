## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce responded to UK sanctions against 11 Chinese enterprises related to Russia. The spokesperson emphasized China's strict compliance with export controls on dual-use items and opposed unilateral UK sanctions lacking UN authorization, demanding their reversal to preserve bilateral trade relations.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-29 (statement date; UK sanctions effective date not specified)

**Scope:** 11 Chinese enterprises sanctioned by the UK government in connection with Russia-related restrictions

## Key Provisions

1. **China's Export Control Compliance Position:** The statement references China's consistent practice of "依法依规严格管控军民两用物项出口" (strictly controlling dual-use items exports according to law and regulations) in the Ukraine crisis context.

2. **Opposition to Unilateral Sanctions:** China opposes UK unilateral sanctions lacking UN Security Council authorization.

3. **Protection of Normal Business Cooperation:** The statement emphasizes that "中俄企业正常交往合作不应受到干扰和影响" (normal business cooperation between Chinese and Russian enterprises should not be disrupted).

4. **Demand for Reversal:** China demands the UK reverse the sanctions to preserve bilateral trade relations.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Medium to High Impact (speculative):** UK sanctions against 11 Chinese enterprises create compliance obligations for UK companies and financial institutions conducting business with the listed entities. Chinese companies operating in sectors involving dual-use items (particularly technology, machinery, and electronics) face increased scrutiny in UK-related transactions. The sanctions may disrupt supply chains where UK and Chinese firms are co-suppliers or buyers in third markets. Companies should conduct sanctions screening to identify whether their Chinese partners or suppliers are among the 11 listed entities. The statement's emphasis on "normal business cooperation" suggests China may implement reciprocal measures if UK companies face operational difficulties in China.

## Notes

This statement was issued on the same day as China's response to EU sanctions (Announcement 1183), suggesting coordinated Western sanctions actions against Chinese entities. The UK sanctions appear related to alleged support for Russia's military capabilities through dual-use item exports. Companies should monitor for potential Chinese countermeasures under the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.
