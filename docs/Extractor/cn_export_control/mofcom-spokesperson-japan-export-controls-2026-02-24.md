## Summary

The MOFCOM spokesperson provided official explanations for the simultaneous release of the Control List (Announcement No. 11) and Watch List (Announcement No. 12) targeting 40 Japanese entities. The spokesperson stated the measures aim to stop Japan's "re-militarization and nuclear weapon ambitions," and emphasized that the measures only target a small number of entities and dual-use items, not affecting normal China-Japan trade. The statement also clarified compliance requirements for exports to unlisted Japanese entities.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: MOFCOM News Office (商务部新闻办公室)
- **Effective Date**: 2026-02-24 (press conference date, concurrent with Announcements No. 11 and No. 12)
- **Scope**: Comprehensive explanation of export control measures targeting Japanese entities

## Key Provisions

### Two-Tier System Explained

1. **Control List (管控名单 — Announcement No. 11)**: 20 entities including Mitsubishi Shipbuilding etc.
   - Complete ban on dual-use item exports to listed entities
   - Ban on overseas transfer of China-origin dual-use items to listed entities
   - Immediate cessation of ongoing activities required

2. **Watch List (关注名单 — Announcement No. 12)**: 20 entities including SUBARU etc.
   - No general licenses permitted; individual licenses required
   - Risk assessment report and written commitment required
   - Extended license review timeline
   - Stricter end-user/end-use verification by MOFCOM
   - Military-related exports will not be approved
   - Removal mechanism available for cooperating entities

### Treatment of Unlisted Japanese Entities

- For unlisted Japanese entities, if exports involve Japanese military users, military purposes, or purposes enhancing Japan's military capabilities, the existing "Announcement on Strengthening Export Control of Dual-Use Items to Japan" (《关于加强两用物项对日本出口管制的公告》) applies — dual-use item exports are prohibited

### Official Rationale

- Purpose: To stop Japan's "re-militarization and nuclear weapon ambitions" (制止日本"再军事化"和拥核企图)
- Characterization: "Completely legitimate, reasonable, and lawful" (完全正当、合理、合法)
- Scope limitation: Only targets a small number of entities and dual-use items
- Reassurance: Does not affect normal China-Japan trade; law-abiding Japanese entities have no cause for concern

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: The following impact assessment contains speculative analysis based on the policy content.**

1. **Escalation Signal**: The spokesperson's framing around "re-militarization" suggests these measures are part of broader geopolitical counter-measures against Japan's defense buildup
2. **Two-Tier Approach**: The differentiated treatment (Control List vs Watch List) indicates China is calibrating its response — outright bans for defense entities, enhanced scrutiny for others
3. **Scope Containment**: The emphasis on "small number of entities" and "dual-use items only" appears designed to prevent market overreaction
4. **Unlisted Entity Risk**: The clarification about unlisted entities creates broader compliance obligations for all Japan-directed dual-use exports
5. **Diplomatic Implications**: The strong language ("re-militarization," "nuclear ambitions") suggests limited near-term de-escalation prospects
6. **Compliance Framework**: Chinese exporters must now navigate three tiers of Japan-related controls: (a) Control List ban, (b) Watch List enhanced licensing, (c) general dual-use items to Japan enhanced controls

## Notes

- Content retrieved via curl fallback from MOFCOM website (2026-02-28)
- This spokesperson statement provides official context for both Announcements No. 11 and No. 12
- The Q&A format is typical for MOFCOM policy guidance communications
- References to the earlier "Announcement on Strengthening Export Control of Dual-Use Items to Japan" suggests these are part of a broader, ongoing policy framework

**Disclaimer**: This policy interpretation is for reference only and does not constitute legal advice. Entities should consult qualified legal counsel for compliance guidance.
