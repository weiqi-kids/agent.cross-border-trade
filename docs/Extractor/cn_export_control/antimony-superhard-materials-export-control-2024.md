## Summary

The Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement No. 33 of 2024, implementing export controls on antimony and superhard materials production equipment, effective September 15, 2024. The controls cover antimony in various forms, organic antimony compounds, indium antimonide, gold-antimony separation technology, and six categories of superhard materials manufacturing equipment and related technologies.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** Ministry of Commerce (商务部) and General Administration of Customs (海关总署)

**Announcement Number:** 2024 No. 33

**Effective Date:** 2024-09-15

**Scope:** Two primary categories—antimony-related items and superhard materials production equipment

---

## Key Provisions

### 1. Antimony-Related Items (锑相关物项)

**Raw Materials:**
- Raw antimony ore in various forms: chunks, granules, powder, crystals
- Metallic antimony and products: ingots, blocks, beads, powder

**High-Purity Products:**
- Antimony oxides with purity ≥99.99%
- Organic antimony compounds: trimethyl antimony, triethyl antimony (purity >99.999%)
- Antimony hydrides (purity >99.999%)

**Compound Semiconductors:**
- Indium antimonide (InSb) with specific crystalline properties

**Technology:**
- Gold-antimony refining separation technology

### 2. Superhard Materials Production Equipment (超硬材料相关设备)

**High-Pressure Manufacturing:**
- Six-face pressure machines with hydraulic capacity ≥10 MN
- Specialized components: hinge beams, anvils, high-pressure control systems

**CVD Equipment:**
- Microwave plasma CVD equipment (10+ kilowatt capacity)

**Materials:**
- Diamond window materials meeting optical and dimensional standards

**Technology:**
- Manufacturing technologies for above equipment

### 3. Licensing Requirements

Exporters must "obtain permits through provincial commerce departments to the Ministry of Commerce" with supporting documentation:
- Export contracts
- Technical specifications
- End-user certifications
- Identity documentation

### 4. Enforcement

"违反本公告规定的,依据有关法律法规承担相应的行政责任或刑事责任" — Violations incur administrative penalties or criminal liability per applicable laws.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** Very High

**Affected Industries:**

**Antimony:**
- Flame retardants (major antimony use, ~60% of global consumption)
- Lead-acid batteries (antimony improves grid strength)
- Defense applications (ammunition, infrared systems)
- Semiconductors (III-V compound semiconductors)

**Superhard Materials Equipment:**
- Synthetic diamond production
- Precision cutting tools manufacturing
- Semiconductor wafer processing
- Advanced ceramics production

**Geographic Considerations (speculative):**
- China produces approximately 48% of global antimony supply
- Major importing countries: US, Japan, Belgium (for further processing), India
- Russia is the second-largest producer (~20% global share), but faces export restrictions due to sanctions
- Alternative suppliers (Tajikistan, Myanmar, Bolivia) have limited production capacity
- Superhard materials equipment controls may impact global synthetic diamond manufacturing capacity

**Strategic Implications (speculative):**
- Antimony critical for defense applications, particularly ammunition and military electronics
- Control of production equipment limits foreign capacity to develop alternative supply chains
- High-purity organic antimony compounds essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing
- Gold-antimony separation technology control suggests concerns about strategic material processing capabilities

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Exporters must classify products against technical specifications to determine control status
- License applications require detailed end-user and end-use documentation
- Provincial commerce departments serve as initial application processing points
- Customs verification procedures for antimony content and purity levels

## Notes

This announcement represents a significant expansion of China's critical minerals export controls. The inclusion of antimony follows earlier 2024 controls on gallium and germanium, indicating a systematic approach to controlling strategic materials supply chains.

The dual focus on raw materials and production equipment/technology demonstrates intent to maintain control over both current supply and future production capacity development. The high-purity specifications for organic antimony compounds target advanced technology applications rather than commodity uses.

China's dominant position in global antimony supply (combined with Russia's restricted capacity) gives this control significant leverage, particularly for defense-related end-uses in Western countries.
