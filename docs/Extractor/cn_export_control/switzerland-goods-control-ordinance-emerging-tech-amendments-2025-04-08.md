## Summary
Switzerland's Federal Council approved amendments to the Goods Control Ordinance on April 2, 2025, adding export controls on dual-use items in emerging technology sectors including semiconductors, quantum computing, and additive manufacturing, effective May 1, 2025, to align with international standards and coordinate with major trading partners.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Swiss Federal Council
- **Effective Date**: 2025-05-01
- **Scope**: Dual-use items in emerging technology sectors including semiconductors, quantum computing, and additive manufacturing
- **Policy Objective**: Align Swiss export controls with international standards and coordinate with major trading partners

## Key Provisions
**Amendment Approval:**
- Federal Council adopted amendments to Goods Control Ordinance on April 2, 2025
- Implements new export control regulations for emerging technology dual-use items

**Newly Controlled Items:**
The revision adds controls on items in the following technology sectors:

1. **Semiconductors**
   - Specific items not detailed in summary (likely includes manufacturing equipment, materials, or technology)

2. **Quantum Computing**
   - Specific items not detailed (likely includes quantum processors, cryogenic systems, control electronics)

3. **Additive Manufacturing**
   - Specific items not detailed (likely includes metal 3D printing systems for aerospace/defense applications)

**Policy Objectives:**
- Ensure Swiss export control measures align with international standards
- Coordinate export control systems with major trading partners
- Incorporate emerging and future technologies into regulatory framework
- Maintain Switzerland's integration with international technology governance regimes

**Effective Date:**
- **May 1, 2025** - provides less than one month implementation window from approval date

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Swiss Technology Sector:**
- Switzerland hosts advanced technology companies in precision manufacturing, semiconductors, and research institutions
- New controls affect Swiss exporters of controlled technologies and components
- Short implementation timeline (one month) requires rapid compliance system updates

**Semiconductor Supply Chains:**
- Swiss precision manufacturing equipment suppliers must implement licensing procedures
- Affects exports to China and other jurisdictions subject to allied technology restrictions
- Coordinates with U.S., EU, Japan controls on semiconductor technology

**Quantum Technology:**
- Switzerland has active quantum research centers (e.g., ETH Zurich, University of Basel)
- Controls may affect international research collaborations and technology transfers
- Aligns with controls implemented by Canada, Japan, New Zealand in previous months

**Additive Manufacturing:**
- Swiss precision engineering firms supply advanced 3D printing systems
- Controls target metal additive manufacturing for strategic applications
- Impact on aerospace and defense supply chains

**Strategic Context - Neutral Nation Joins Allied Controls:**
- Switzerland's historic neutrality makes this alignment significant
- Reflects pressure for coordinated approach on strategic technologies among Western nations
- Demonstrates limits of neutrality in technology export governance
- May signal similar moves by other traditionally neutral or non-aligned technology suppliers

**International Coordination:**
- Follows similar measures by Five Eyes nations (Canada, New Zealand)
- Aligns with EU dual-use controls and U.S. export restrictions
- Part of multilateral effort to prevent strategic technology proliferation

**Compliance Considerations:**
- **Tight timeline**: Less than one month from approval to effectiveness
- Swiss exporters should immediately review product portfolios
- International buyers of Swiss technology should verify license requirements
- Existing contracts may require renegotiation or licensing amendments

**Affected Industries:**
- Semiconductor manufacturing equipment
- Quantum computing components and systems
- Advanced manufacturing equipment (3D printing)
- Precision instruments and controls
- Research and development institutions
