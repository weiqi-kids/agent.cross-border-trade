## Summary

China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, enacted on June 10, 2021, provides legal authority for countermeasures against foreign entities and individuals implementing discriminatory sanctions against Chinese interests. The law establishes mechanisms for creating counteraction lists and mandates compliance by organizations and individuals within China's jurisdiction.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-06-10
- **Scope**: Applies to foreign states, organizations, and individuals imposing discriminatory restrictions on China; enforcement extends to entities and persons within China's territory

## Key Provisions

1. **Legislative Purpose**: Maintain national sovereignty, security, and development interests; protect lawful rights of Chinese citizens and organizations

2. **Counteraction Lists**: Government departments authorized to create lists targeting individuals and organizations involved in implementing foreign sanctions against China

3. **Enforcement Measures**: Authorized measures include:
   - Visa denial or revocation
   - Asset freezing within Chinese jurisdiction
   - Prohibition of transactions with Chinese citizens and organizations
   - Other necessary measures as determined by relevant departments

4. **Extended Liability**: Sanctions extend to family members of listed individuals, senior managers of listed organizations, and affiliated entities

5. **Mandatory Compliance**: Organizations and individuals within China's territory must execute counteraction measures adopted by state departments; non-compliance triggers legal consequences

6. **Litigation Rights**: Chinese citizens and organizations may pursue legal action against entities violating prohibitions on executing foreign sanctions

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Cross-Border Trade Implications** (Speculative Analysis):

- **Compliance Complexity**: Foreign companies operating in China may face conflicting legal obligations when home country sanctions conflict with China's counteraction measures, creating compliance dilemmas in supply chain decisions

- **Transaction Risk**: The prohibition on transactions with listed entities could disrupt established supply chains if key suppliers or customers are subject to countermeasures, particularly affecting technology, aerospace, and defense-related sectors

- **Asset Freezing Impact**: Companies with assets in China face potential freezing risk if corporate actions are deemed supportive of foreign sanctions, potentially affecting working capital and operational continuity

- **Third-Party Exposure**: The extension of liability to affiliated entities and senior managers increases risk for multinational corporations with complex ownership structures and may deter intermediary participation in certain transactions

- **Strategic Decoupling Pressure**: The law may accelerate supply chain diversification strategies as companies seek to reduce exposure to conflicting jurisdictional requirements, particularly in dual-use goods sectors

WebFetch successful. Source JSONL contained corrupted Chinese characters but full content retrieved from official website. This is a foundational legislation that establishes legal framework for Chinese countermeasures rather than specific export control provisions, but has significant implications for cross-border trade compliance.
