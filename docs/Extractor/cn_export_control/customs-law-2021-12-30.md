## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Clearance Timelines**: All imports/exports must undergo customs declaration and inspection, creating processing delays
- **Compliance Burden**: Accurate classification, valuation, and documentation required for all shipments
- **Bonding Requirements**: Guarantees needed for special trade regimes (processing trade, temporary imports, bonded storage)
- **Inspection Risk**: Physical examination may occur at any time, causing shipment delays

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Manufacturing/Processing Trade**: Special bonded regimes reduce duty burden but require strict recordkeeping and reconciliation
- **E-commerce/Cross-Border Retail**: Personal item limits and inspection requirements affect direct-to-consumer shipments
- **Logistics/Freight**: Vehicle registration and cargo manifest requirements affect transportation efficiency
- **Luxury Goods/Consumer Electronics**: High-value items face stricter inspection and higher tariff rates

### Strategic Considerations
- Customs has authority to adjust declared values if transfer pricing suspected
- Anti-smuggling enforcement includes criminal liability for serious violations
- Special customs regimes (bonded zones, free trade zones) offer tax advantages but require operational compliance
- Administrative review mechanisms provide recourse for disputed customs decisions
- Integration with export control system means customs enforces license requirements
