## Summary
China announced adjustments to export control blacklist measures against US entities following China-US Kuala Lumpur economic consultations. From November 10, 2025, measures targeting 15 US entities from Notice No. 13 will be suspended, and 16 entities from Notice No. 21 will have measures paused for one additional year.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-10
- **Scope**: 31 US entities previously on export control blacklists (Notices No. 13 and No. 21, 2025)

## Key Provisions
- Commerce Ministry previously issued Notices No. 13 and No. 21 in 2025, placing 31 American entities on export control lists
- These notices prohibited dual-use exports to listed entities
- Following China-US Kuala Lumpur bilateral consultations consensus:
  - **15 US entities from Notice No. 13**: Measures fully suspended from November 10, 2025
  - **16 entities from Notice No. 21**: Measures paused for one additional year
- Exporters seeking to ship dual-use items to these entities must submit applications to Commerce Ministry for review

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**De-escalation Signal**: This represents significant easing of China-US export control tensions. The suspension of restrictions on 15 entities and extended pause for 16 others reduces barriers for US companies in semiconductors, aerospace, and other dual-use sectors. Companies should prepare application processes for dual-use exports, as case-by-case review remains required. The measures suggest both countries are prioritizing supply chain stability over punitive actions.
