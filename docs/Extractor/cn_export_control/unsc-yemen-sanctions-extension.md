## Summary

The UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2758(2024) on November 13, 2024, extending Yemen sanctions (travel bans and asset freezes) for 12 months through November 15, 2025, and extending the expert panel mandate for 13 months through December 15, 2025.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** UN Security Council
- **Effective Date:** 2024-11-13 (adoption date); sanctions extended through 2025-11-15; expert panel through 2025-12-15
- **Scope:** Yemen sanctions regime including travel bans and asset freezes; expert panel supporting Yemen Sanctions Committee

## Key Provisions

1. **Resolution Adoption**: UN Security Council Resolution 2758(2024) adopted unanimously under Chapter VII of the UN Charter
2. **Sanctions Extension**: Travel bans and asset freezes on designated individuals/entities extended for additional 12 months through November 15, 2025
3. **Expert Panel Extension**: Mandate of expert panel assisting the Yemen Sanctions Committee extended for 13 months through December 15, 2025
4. **Chapter VII Authority**: Adopted under Chapter VII, indicating binding nature and potential enforcement measures

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Shipping and Logistics**: Yemen sanctions primarily affect maritime and logistics companies; continued asset freezes and travel bans require ongoing due diligence on Yemen-related cargo, vessel ownership, and beneficial ownership chains
- **Financial Services**: Banks must maintain screening protocols for Yemen-designated entities; extension maintains compliance burden for financial institutions handling Middle East transactions
- **Humanitarian Operations**: Sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian aid, but extension sustains complexity for NGOs and aid organizations operating in Yemen requiring careful compliance with exemption procedures
- **Energy Sector**: Yemen's oil/gas sector historically linked to sanctions concerns; continued restrictions affect companies potentially involved in Yemen energy transactions, particularly vessel owners and commodity traders
- **Expert Panel Continuation**: 13-month extension (one month longer than sanctions) allows for comprehensive end-of-mandate reporting; expert panel investigations may identify additional entities for designation, creating ongoing compliance uncertainty

## Notes

Resolution 2758(2024) represents routine extension of Yemen sanctions regime, which has been in place since 2014 (Resolution 2140). The unanimous adoption indicates continued international consensus on Yemen sanctions despite broader geopolitical divisions in Security Council. Yemen sanctions target individuals and entities threatening peace/stability, obstructing humanitarian access, or violating arms embargo.
