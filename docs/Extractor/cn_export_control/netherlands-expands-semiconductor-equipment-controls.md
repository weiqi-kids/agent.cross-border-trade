## Summary

On September 6, 2024, the Netherlands announced an expansion of national export control measures targeting advanced semiconductor production equipment, effective September 7, 2024. The new restrictions broaden the categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment requiring export license applications, building on controls that first became effective September 1, 2023. This represents a further tightening of Dutch export controls in the strategically sensitive semiconductor equipment sector.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Government of the Netherlands
- **Effective Date:** 2024-09-07
- **Scope:** Advanced semiconductor production equipment (expanded categories compared to 2023 controls)

## Key Provisions

1. **Expanded Scope:** More categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment now require export licenses
2. **Building on 2023 Controls:** Represents expansion of restrictions first implemented September 1, 2023
3. **National Measure:** Netherlands exercising national discretion to control advanced technology exports
4. **License Requirement:** Exporters must apply for and obtain licenses for covered equipment categories

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment (speculative)

**Affected Sectors:** Advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, lithography systems, deposition equipment, etching systems, wafer processing

**Potential Supply Chain Effects:**
- **ASML and Dutch Equipment Suppliers:** Primary impact on Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment manufacturers, particularly ASML (world leader in extreme ultraviolet lithography)
- Customers in certain countries (likely including China) face additional barriers to acquiring advanced Dutch semiconductor equipment
- Expanded scope suggests controls now cover broader range of chipmaking technologies beyond most advanced lithography
- May impact equipment maintenance, spare parts, and technical support services for previously exported systems
- Potential delays in equipment delivery due to licensing procedures

**Geographic Scope:**
- **Exporting Country:** Netherlands
- **Likely Primary Target:** China's advanced semiconductor manufacturing sector
- **Context:** Coordinates with US semiconductor export controls and broader allied technology restrictions

**Technology Leadership Implications:**
- Netherlands holds critical position in global semiconductor supply chain via ASML's lithography monopoly
- Expanded controls leverage Dutch technological advantage for geopolitical objectives
- Reflects coordination with US and likely other allies (Japan, EU) on semiconductor technology restrictions

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Dutch exporters must determine if their equipment falls under expanded categories
- Companies should review 2023 controls and identify additional items now requiring licenses
- International customers should assess potential delays or restrictions on Dutch equipment procurement

## Notes

- Article classified as "编译" (compilation/translation) from Netherlands government official source
- Published via China's Ministry of Commerce Export Control Information Network
- Represents second phase of Dutch semiconductor equipment controls (first phase: September 1, 2023)
- Timing aligns with broader Western coordination on technology export restrictions
- Expansion suggests initial 2023 controls deemed insufficient or requiring broader scope
- Netherlands' strategic position as semiconductor equipment supplier gives its controls disproportionate impact on global chip manufacturing
