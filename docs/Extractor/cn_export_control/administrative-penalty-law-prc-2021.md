## Summary

The Administrative Penalty Law of the People's Republic of China is a comprehensive procedural law governing how administrative agencies impose penalties for regulatory violations. Originally enacted in 1996 and comprehensively revised in 2021 (effective July 15, 2021), it establishes uniform enforcement standards and procedural protections across all administrative sectors including export control enforcement.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee (Thirteenth Session, Twenty-fifth Meeting)
- **Effective Date**: July 15, 2021
- **Scope**: All administrative agencies in China implementing penalties across sectors including commerce, customs, environmental protection, and market regulation; applies to both domestic and international actors within Chinese territory

## Key Provisions

### Types of Administrative Penalties (Article 9)
1. Warnings and public criticism
2. Fines and asset confiscation
3. License suspension or revocation
4. Business operation restrictions or closure
5. Administrative detention
6. Other penalties prescribed by law

### Procedural Protections
- **Article 44**: Parties must receive advance notice of proposed penalties including facts, reasons, and evidence; parties retain the right to state facts, defend themselves, and request hearings
- **Article 45**: Agencies must fully listen to the opinions of the involved party and cannot impose harsher penalties based on their defense

### Enforcement Requirements
- Penalties must be based on verified facts with clear evidence
- Non-legal evidence cannot support enforcement
- Agencies must maintain complete process documentation
- Financial penalties require separation between decision-makers and collection officials
- 90-day timeline from case initiation to penalty issuance (unless law specifies otherwise)

### Applicability to Foreign Entities
The law applies to foreign nationals and organizations operating in Chinese territory, creating uniform enforcement standards for international actors subject to export control regulations.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*The following represents analytical assessment based on policy implications:*

This foundational law significantly impacts export control enforcement by:

1. **Enforcement Predictability**: The standardized procedures and timeline requirements (90-day case resolution) provide greater predictability for companies under investigation for export control violations, enabling better compliance planning and legal response strategies.

2. **Due Process Rights**: The strengthened procedural protections (Articles 44-45) give exporters facing penalties for dual-use item violations formal rights to present evidence and defend their positions, potentially reducing arbitrary enforcement outcomes.

3. **International Compliance**: The explicit application to foreign entities operating in China means multinational corporations must ensure their China operations comply with local export control regulations or face administrative penalties under this framework.

4. **Documentation Requirements**: The mandate for complete process documentation increases transparency but also means companies must maintain thorough compliance records to defend against potential penalties.

5. **Penalty Severity**: The six-category penalty framework allows proportionate responses ranging from warnings to business closure, giving authorities flexibility in addressing export control violations of varying severity.

## Notes

WebFetch successful. Article is a procedural law governing administrative penalties rather than specific export control regulations. It establishes the enforcement framework that applies when export control violations occur. The law serves as the legal foundation for how agencies like MOFCOM impose penalties for violations of export control regulations (such as the Export Control Law or dual-use item lists).
