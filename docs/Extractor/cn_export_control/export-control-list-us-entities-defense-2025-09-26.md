## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce issued Announcement 2025 No. 51 on September 25, 2025, adding three U.S. defense and technology entities to its export control list, prohibiting the export of dual-use items to these organizations. The measure implements the Export Control Law to maintain national security and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (商务部)
- **Effective Date**: September 25, 2025 (upon publication)
- **Scope**: Three U.S. entities - defense contractor, management consultancy, and technology services firm

## Key Provisions

**Legal Basis:**
- Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China
- Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations

**Controlled Entities:**
1. **Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.** (major U.S. defense contractor, shipbuilding)
2. **Planate Management Group** (defense/intelligence consulting)
3. **Global Dimensions LLC** (technology and engineering services)

**Export Prohibition:**
- Dual-use items are prohibited from export to the three listed U.S. entities
- Existing export activities must cease immediately

**Exception Process:**
Under special circumstances requiring exports, operators must submit applications to the Ministry of Commerce for case-by-case review.

**Stated Purpose:**
To maintain national security and interests and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Affected Sectors:**
- Defense and military technology supply chains
- Shipbuilding and naval systems
- Advanced electronics and communications systems
- Aerospace and satellite technologies

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **Defense Contractor Targeting**: Huntington Ingalls Industries is one of the largest U.S. defense contractors (primarily naval shipbuilding), suggesting this measure targets entities with military end-use connections.

2. **Dual-Use Technology Restrictions**: Chinese suppliers of electronics, materials, and components used in defense applications will face compliance requirements.

3. **Supply Chain Diversification Pressure**: Affected entities will need to source dual-use components from non-Chinese suppliers, potentially increasing costs and lead times.

4. **Reciprocal Action Pattern**: This follows similar U.S. entity list actions against Chinese companies, indicating continued tit-for-tat enforcement.

**Business Impact:**
- Chinese exporters must screen transactions against this list
- Affected U.S. entities must seek alternative sources for Chinese-origin dual-use items
- Potential cascading effects on subcontractors and supply chain partners
- Increased compliance costs for companies operating in both markets

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full announcement retrieved. This action aligns with China's pattern of responding to U.S. export controls with reciprocal measures. The inclusion of Huntington Ingalls Industries (a major naval shipbuilder) is particularly significant, as it represents one of the largest U.S. defense contractors to be explicitly named on China's export control list.
