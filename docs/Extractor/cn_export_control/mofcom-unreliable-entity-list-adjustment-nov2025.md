## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce announced adjustments to the Unreliable Entity List measures following bilateral trade consultations with the United States in Kuala Lumpur. The measures include suspending certain restrictions for one year and terminating others, while establishing a transaction approval pathway for domestic enterprises.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-10

**Scope:** Foreign entities previously listed on China's Unreliable Entity List as announced in March and April 2025

## Key Provisions

1. **Suspension of April 4, 2025 Measures:** China will continue suspending measures from the April 4, 2025 announcement for one additional year, starting November 10, 2025.

2. **Cessation of March 4, 2025 Measures:** Measures announced on March 4, 2025 will be terminated.

3. **Transaction Approval Pathway:** Domestic enterprises may apply to conduct transactions with the affected entities. Applications will be reviewed lawfully by the Unreliable Entity List working mechanism ("国内企业可申请与上述实体进行交易,不可靠实体清单工作机制将依法进行审核").

4. **Policy Context:** The adjustments implement the bilateral economic consensus reached during China-US trade consultations.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Low to Medium Impact (speculative):** This policy adjustment represents a de-escalation in trade restrictions between China and the United States. Companies previously restricted under the Unreliable Entity List may now apply for transaction approval, potentially reopening supply chain pathways that were previously blocked. The one-year suspension period suggests a phased approach to normalization, providing businesses with a defined timeframe to restructure supply chain relationships. US entities and their Chinese partners should prepare documentation for the application process to restore business transactions.

## Notes

This announcement follows China-US trade negotiations in Kuala Lumpur and represents a concrete implementation of bilateral economic agreements. The distinction between "suspension" (for April measures) and "cessation" (for March measures) indicates differentiated policy treatment based on the original measures' nature or severity.
