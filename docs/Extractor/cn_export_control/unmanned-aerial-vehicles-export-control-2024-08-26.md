## Summary
The Ministry of Commerce, General Administration of Customs, and Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department issued Announcement 2024 No. 31, implementing comprehensive export controls on unmanned aerial vehicles and related components effective September 1, 2024. The regulation controls aircraft engines exceeding 16kW, advanced payload equipment (infrared, radar, laser), long-range communication systems, and counter-UAS systems, with a catch-all provision prohibiting exports supporting weapons proliferation or terrorism.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce, General Administration of Customs, Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department (three-agency joint announcement)
- **Effective Date**: 2024-09-01
- **Scope**: Exporters of unmanned aircraft engines, payload equipment (sensors, targeting systems), communication equipment, counter-UAS systems; includes catch-all provision for non-listed items with knowledge of military/terrorism end-use

## Key Provisions

**Category 1 - Aircraft Engines:**
- Maximum continuous power exceeding 16 kilowatts for unmanned systems
- Specific customs codes listed for classification
- Covers internal combustion, electric, and hybrid propulsion systems

**Category 2 - Payload Equipment:**

*Infrared Imaging Devices:*
- Wavelengths between 780-30,000 nanometers
- Instantaneous field of view under 2.5 milliradians
- High-resolution thermal imaging systems

*Synthetic Aperture Radar:*
- Range exceeding 5 kilometers
- Specified resolution capabilities
- Ground mapping and target recognition systems

*Laser Designators:*
- Functioning above 55°C
- Energy exceeding 80 millijoules
- Precision targeting equipment

*Inertial Measurement Systems:*
- Meeting precision thresholds for navigation
- Gyroscopes and accelerometers for autonomous flight

**Category 3 - Communication Equipment:**
- Wireless systems with transmission range over 50 kilometers
- Capability controlling multiple aircraft simultaneously
- Beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) control systems
- Mesh networking and swarm coordination technologies

**Category 4 - Counter-UAS Systems:**
- Electronic jamming equipment
- High-power lasers exceeding specified parameters
- RF disruption and directed energy weapons
- Drone detection and neutralization systems

**Catch-All Provision (General Prohibition):**
- Exporters with knowledge that unmanned aircraft exports support weapons proliferation, terrorism, or military purposes **cannot proceed, regardless of listing status**
- Applies to non-listed items when end-use is known or suspected
- Imposes due diligence obligation on exporters

**Export Procedures:**
Applicants must submit through provincial commerce departments with required documentation:
- Export contracts
- Technical specifications
- End-use certifications
- Importer background information
- Identification documents

**Enforcement:**
- Administrative penalties for unauthorized exports
- Criminal prosecution for serious violations
- Enhanced customs inspection at ports

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Critical Supply Chain Nodes:**
- **Commercial Drone Manufacturers:** DJI and other Chinese drone manufacturers exporting to global markets face extensive licensing requirements
- **Component Suppliers:** Engine, sensor, and communication module suppliers must verify end-users
- **Agriculture/Surveying:** Commercial applications using high-specification sensors require export permits
- **Research Institutions:** Academic drone research involving controlled technologies faces export restrictions

**Industry Sectors Affected:**
- **Agriculture:** Precision agriculture drones with advanced imaging systems
- **Infrastructure Inspection:** Long-range drones for pipeline, powerline, and railway monitoring
- **Surveying and Mapping:** High-resolution SAR and optical systems for geospatial data collection
- **Emergency Response:** Long-range communication systems for disaster response and search-rescue
- **Defense Industry:** Military-grade counter-UAS systems and tactical reconnaissance platforms

**International Trade Impact:**
- Major disruption to global commercial drone supply chains dominated by Chinese manufacturers
- Foreign customers requiring high-performance drones face licensing delays
- Agriculture and infrastructure sectors dependent on Chinese drones must secure stable supply agreements
- Research collaboration involving advanced drone technologies requires comprehensive export compliance

**Catch-All Provision Implications:**
- Exporters bear responsibility for investigating end-use even for non-listed items
- Knowledge standard creates liability for willful blindness to military/terrorism applications
- Enhanced due diligence requirements increase compliance costs
- Risk of retroactive enforcement if end-use diversion discovered

**Technical Specification Impact:**
- 16kW engine threshold captures most commercial long-endurance platforms
- 50km communication range covers professional-grade agriculture and surveying systems
- Infrared and SAR specifications include high-end commercial reconnaissance capabilities
- Counter-UAS controls limit proliferation of drone defense technologies

**Strategic Context:**
- Addresses international concerns about Chinese drones supporting military applications
- Aligns with UN-sponsored export control frameworks for military and dual-use technologies
- Protects China's technological leadership in commercial drone manufacturing
- Balances commercial export opportunities with security and non-proliferation obligations

## Notes
WebFetch successful - full policy content retrieved. This announcement represents one of the most comprehensive drone export control frameworks globally, published July 31, 2024, with September 1, 2024 effective date. The inclusion of Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department emphasizes security concerns driving the regulation. The catch-all provision creates broad authority to restrict exports based on end-use knowledge, significantly expanding government discretion beyond listed items. This regulation responds to international scrutiny of Chinese drones in military applications while maintaining controls over advanced counter-UAS technologies.
