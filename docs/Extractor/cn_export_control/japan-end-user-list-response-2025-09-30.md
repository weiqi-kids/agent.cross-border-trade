## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce responded to Japan's September 29 update to its export control end-user list, which added several Chinese enterprises while removing two others. China opposes the additions as lacking factual basis and damaging bilateral business interests, while welcoming the removals and expressing willingness to strengthen communication for additional de-listings.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce Press Office (商务部新闻办公室)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-09-29 (Japan's list update)
- **Scope**: Multiple Chinese enterprises added to Japan's end-user list; two removed

## Key Provisions
- **China's Opposition**: Japan added Chinese enterprises to the list without factual basis, damaging bilateral business interests
- **China's Demand**: Calls on Japan to immediately cease listing Chinese companies
- **Positive Acknowledgment**: China welcomes Japan's removal of two Chinese entities from the list
- **Bilateral Interest**: Views removals as consistent with mutual interests
- **Cooperation Intent**: China expresses willingness to strengthen communication with Japan to facilitate removal of additional Chinese enterprises from the list
- **Diplomatic Tone**: More measured compared to responses to U.S. and EU actions, suggesting room for bilateral engagement

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
Japan's end-user list updates reflect Tokyo's alignment with U.S.-led technology export controls targeting China while maintaining some pragmatic flexibility. The simultaneous additions and removals suggest Japan is attempting to balance security concerns with economic interests in China. Chinese entities on Japan's end-user list face restrictions accessing Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment, materials, and advanced technology. However, China's diplomatic response emphasizes dialogue rather than immediate retaliation, suggesting both countries seek to manage supply chain disruptions through engagement rather than escalation.
