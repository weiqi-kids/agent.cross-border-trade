## Summary
Six Chinese government agencies jointly announced optimized management measures for products containing γ-butyrolactone (GBL), a controlled precursor chemical. Effective January 1, 2024, the regulation establishes concentration-based exemptions: products with GBL content below 60% (photoresists, polyimide films) and below 20% (printing inks) are exempted from import/export licensing and domestic transaction documentation requirements.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Commerce, National Health Commission, Emergency Management Department, General Administration of Customs, National Medical Products Administration (six-agency joint announcement)
- **Effective Date**: 2024-01-01
- **Scope**: Import, operation, and use of products containing γ-butyrolactone (GBL); semiconductor manufacturing materials (photoresists, alignment films); printing industry (inks and cleaning cartridges)

## Key Provisions

**GBL Content <60% Exemptions:**
- **Covered Products:** Photoresists, polyimide alignment films, diluents, photosensitive liquids, anti-reflective coating solutions
- **Exemptions:** No import licensing required, no domestic transaction documentation required

**GBL Content <20% Exemptions:**
- **Covered Products:** Printing inks (including cleaning cartridges)
- **Exemptions:** No import/export permits required, no domestic operational documentation required

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Enterprises must maintain internal safety protocols
- Accurate records of production, storage, and disposal activities required
- Truthful declaration of γ-butyrolactone content during customs procedures mandatory
- Full responsibility for regulatory compliance and preventing illegal distribution

**Enforcement:**
- Enhanced monitoring and inspections across production, operation, and transportation sectors
- Legal consequences for violations
- Government agencies conducting coordinated enforcement activities

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Beneficiary Industries:**
- **Semiconductor Manufacturing:** Streamlined import of photoresist chemicals essential for chip fabrication
- **Display Manufacturing:** Simplified procedures for polyimide alignment films used in LCD/OLED production
- **Printing Industry:** Reduced administrative burden for ink imports and domestic transactions

**Operational Benefits:**
- Elimination of import licensing delays for semiconductor chemicals
- Reduced compliance costs for legitimate industrial users
- Faster customs clearance for time-sensitive semiconductor materials
- Enhanced competitiveness of China-based electronics manufacturing

**Remaining Obligations:**
- Companies still responsible for truthful customs declarations
- Internal control systems required despite licensing exemptions
- Record-keeping obligations continue for audit purposes
- Liability for diversion to illegal drug manufacturing remains

**Risk Management:**
- Clear concentration thresholds (60% and 20%) provide objective compliance criteria
- Reduced regulatory friction without compromising anti-drug enforcement
- Balances legitimate industrial needs with precursor chemical control objectives

**Strategic Context:**
- Supports China's semiconductor self-sufficiency goals by easing supply chain constraints
- Aligns with broader policy of optimizing business environment while maintaining security controls
- Part of targeted regulatory reform reducing unnecessary restrictions on industrial chemicals

## Notes
WebFetch successful - full policy content retrieved. This regulation represents a significant optimization for China's semiconductor and electronics manufacturing supply chains, published on December 5, 2023, with January 1, 2024 effective date. The six-agency coordination demonstrates comprehensive approach balancing anti-drug enforcement with industrial development priorities. The clear concentration-based thresholds provide certainty for manufacturers and importers.
