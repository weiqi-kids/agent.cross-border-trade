## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce issued Announcement 2025 No. 61 on October 9, 2025, establishing comprehensive controls on rare earth re-exports by foreign entities, requiring licenses for third-country exports of products containing Chinese-origin rare earth materials above 0.1% value threshold or manufactured using Chinese rare earth technology, with phased implementation starting December 1, 2025.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (商务部)
- **Effective Date**: Sections 1(a) and 1(b): December 1, 2025; Section 1(c): October 9, 2025 (immediate)
- **Scope**: Extraterritorial control over Chinese-origin rare earth materials and technology

## Key Provisions

**1. Scope of Control - Foreign Entity Licensing:**
Foreign entities must obtain export licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce before exporting controlled rare earth items to countries other than China, covering:
- Items containing Chinese-origin rare earth materials above 0.1% value threshold
- Products manufactured using Chinese rare earth technology
- Items originating from China

**2. Prohibited Export Categories (General Denial):**
The Ministry will generally deny licenses for exports to:
- Military end-users
- Entities on control lists (export control list, unreliable entity list, etc.)
- Uses involving weapons of mass destruction
- Terrorism-related applications
- Military advancement purposes

**3. Special Review Categories:**
- **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: Case-by-case review for exports used in manufacturing 14nm logic chips or 256-layer 3D NAND storage chips
- **Military AI Applications**: Case-by-case review for potential military artificial intelligence uses
- **Humanitarian Emergencies**: Expedited processing for disaster relief and humanitarian purposes

**4. Compliance Requirements:**

**Domestic Exporters:**
- Complete end-destination declarations
- Provide compliance notices to foreign recipients

**Foreign Exporters:**
- Apply directly to Ministry of Commerce or through authorized Chinese intermediaries
- Submit documentation in Chinese language
- Report humanitarian exports within 10 business days to jingwaibaogao@mofcom.gov.cn
- Direct technical inquiries to jingwaizixun@mofcom.gov.cn

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Unprecedented Extraterritorial Reach:**
This represents China's most extensive assertion of extraterritorial export control authority, extending Chinese jurisdiction to:
1. Re-exports by foreign companies of products containing Chinese rare earth materials
2. Products manufactured anywhere using Chinese rare earth technology
3. Third-country transactions not involving Chinese territory

**Affected Industries:**
- **Electronics Manufacturing**: Products incorporating rare earth magnets, phosphors, catalysts (smartphones, computers, displays)
- **Automotive**: Electric vehicle motors using neodymium magnets, catalytic converters
- **Defense**: Guidance systems, jet engines, radar systems, precision-guided munitions
- **Renewable Energy**: Wind turbine generators, solar panel manufacturing
- **Medical Devices**: MRI machines, X-ray equipment

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **Supply Chain Traceability**: Companies must now track:
   - Chinese-origin rare earth content by value (0.1% threshold is very low)
   - Whether manufacturing processes used Chinese rare earth technology
   - Ultimate end-use and end-user of products

2. **Semiconductor Sector Impact**: The 14nm/256-layer threshold specifically targets advanced chip manufacturing, aligning with broader technology competition dynamics.

3. **Compliance Burden**:
   - Foreign manufacturers must apply to Chinese authorities for re-export permission
   - Chinese-language documentation requirements
   - Risk of denial for military, dual-use, or sensitive end-users
   - Potential delays affecting time-sensitive supply chains

4. **Enforcement Challenges**:
   - How China will monitor and enforce third-country transactions
   - Potential conflicts with other jurisdictions' export control laws
   - Risk of supply chain disruption if enforcement is aggressive

**Business Response Requirements:**
- Immediate audit of rare earth content in product lines
- Assessment of manufacturing technology provenance
- Development of alternative sourcing strategies
- Enhanced end-use/end-user screening procedures
- Legal analysis of conflicting regulatory obligations

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full announcement retrieved with detailed compliance provisions. This announcement represents a significant escalation in China's export control strategy, moving from controlling direct exports to asserting authority over global supply chains. The 0.1% value threshold for Chinese-origin content is extremely low and will capture a vast range of products. The extraterritorial approach mirrors U.S. re-export controls but is unprecedented for China. Implementation will be critical to assess practical enforcement approach.
