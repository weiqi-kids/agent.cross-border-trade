## Summary

The Administrative License Law of the People's Republic of China establishes the legal framework and procedural requirements for all administrative licensing activities. Originally passed in 2003 and amended in 2019, this foundational law governs how administrative agencies grant permits for controlled activities, including export control licenses, ensuring transparency, fairness, and legal compliance in the licensing process.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee
- **Effective Date**: 2004-07-01 (original); 2019-04-23 (latest amendment)
- **Scope**: Applies to all administrative licensing activities including export control permits, professional credentials, enterprise establishment, natural resource development, equipment inspections, and national security-related activities

## Key Provisions

**Core Principles:**
- Administrative licenses must adhere to principles of openness, fairness, justice, and non-discrimination
- All licensing regulations, conditions, and procedures must be publicly disclosed
- Protection of applicants' commercial secrets and confidential business information

**Procedural Requirements:**
- Maximum 20-day processing period for license decisions (extendable by 10 days with approval)
- Administrative agencies must provide application format templates
- Written decisions required for all license denials with stated reasons
- Applicants have right to request hearings for discretionary decisions

**Application Process:**
- Citizens, legal entities, or other organizations may apply for licenses to engage in specific controlled activities
- Applications undergo lawful examination by competent administrative agencies
- Agencies must verify authenticity and completeness of submitted materials

**Enforcement Framework:**
- Administrative penalties for agencies: corrective orders, sanctions for responsible officials, or removal from office for violations
- Criminal liability for fraud, bribery, or embezzlement in licensing process
- Applicant penalties: warnings for false applications; one-year reapplication bans for safety-related permit violations

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[Speculative Analysis]**

This law provides the foundational legal framework for China's export control licensing system. Key supply chain implications include:

1. **Processing Time Predictability**: The 20-day (plus potential 10-day extension) maximum processing period provides baseline expectations for export license approval timelines, though actual processing may vary based on item sensitivity and review complexity.

2. **Transparency Requirements**: The mandate for public disclosure of licensing regulations and conditions should theoretically enhance compliance planning for exporters, though implementation consistency across different commodities and jurisdictions may vary.

3. **Commercial Confidentiality**: Protection provisions for commercial secrets and undisclosed information may provide some safeguards for proprietary technology details disclosed in license applications, though enforcement effectiveness remains implementation-dependent.

4. **Appeal Mechanisms**: The right to request hearings for discretionary decisions provides potential recourse pathways for denied export license applications, though practical accessibility and success rates are uncertain.

5. **Compliance Risk**: The one-year reapplication ban for false applications creates significant penalty risk for documentation errors or misrepresentations in export control declarations, potentially disrupting supply chains for extended periods.

## Notes

This article represents foundational administrative law that underpins China's export control licensing framework. While it does not specify controlled items or export control-specific procedures, it establishes the legal principles and procedural requirements that govern all administrative licensing, including export control permits issued under the Export Control Law of 2020.

The 2021-12-30 publication date likely reflects re-publication or citation date on the Ministry of Commerce website rather than a new amendment date.
