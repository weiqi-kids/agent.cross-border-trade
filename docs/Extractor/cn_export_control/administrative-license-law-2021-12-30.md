## Summary
China's Administrative License Law establishes comprehensive procedures for government agencies to grant permissions for specific activities, protecting citizens' equal rights to obtain licenses while maintaining public order. The law mandates standard 20-day decision timelines (with 10-day extension possible), prohibits technology transfer demands as licensing conditions, and enables administrative review or litigation to challenge improper denials.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: National People's Congress Standing Committee
- **Effective Date**: 2004-07-01 (enacted 2003-08-27; amended 2019-04-23)
- **Scope**: All administrative licenses granted by government agencies for specific activities requiring official permission

## Key Provisions

### Eight-Chapter Structure

- Defines administrative license as "permission granted by administrative agencies for citizens, legal persons, or other organizations to engage in specific activities"
- Establishes principle of equal access: applicants meeting legal conditions have equal rights to obtain licenses
- Balances economic freedom with regulatory oversight

**Chapter 2 - Setting Administrative Licenses**
Licenses may be established for:
- Activities involving limited natural resources, public resources, or scarce public goods
- Activities directly related to public safety, personal health, or property safety requiring special conditions
- Activities affecting overall economic development requiring coordination
- Qualified service providers in specific industries
- Other matters requiring legal basis

Prohibitions:
- Cannot establish licenses for matters that can be regulated by market mechanisms
- Cannot demand conditions beyond statutory requirements

**Chapter 3 - Implementing Agencies**
- Specifies which government bodies have licensing authority
- Requires clear authorization for delegated licensing
- Prohibits agencies from exceeding jurisdictional scope

**Chapter 4 - Implementation Procedures**
Key procedural requirements:

1. **Application**: Applicant submits required materials
2. **Acceptance**: Agency reviews completeness (five-day decision on acceptance)
3. **Review**: Agency examines substantive compliance
4. **Decision**:
   - Standard timeline: **20 days from acceptance**
   - Extension: additional 10 days with supervisor approval
   - Simplified: immediate for standardized conditions
5. **Hearing**: Required for major public interest impact
6. **Issuance**: License granted if conditions met

**Important Prohibition (Implied)**: Government agencies cannot demand technology transfer as licensing condition

**Chapter 5 - Fees and Costs**

- Revenue deposited in national treasury (not retained by issuing agency)

**Chapter 7 - Legal Liability**
Administrative penalties for officials who:
- Improperly deny licenses to qualified applicants

- Fail to follow procedures
- Accept bribes or engage in corruption

Applicant remedies:

- Administrative litigation (judicial review)
- Compensation for improper denial

**Chapter 8 - Supplementary Provisions**

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Export License Applications**: Export control licenses governed by these procedures (20-day standard timeline)
- **Import Licenses**: Technology imports and controlled items subject to procedural requirements
- **Technology Transfer Protection**: Prohibition on demanding technology transfer as licensing condition
- **Predictable Timelines**: Standard 20-day (extendable to 30 days) provides planning certainty

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Export Control**: Export licenses for controlled items follow these procedures; denials subject to administrative review
- **Foreign Investment**: Investment approvals must comply with equal access and procedural requirements
- **Technology Licensing**: Foreign technology imports cannot be conditioned on forced technology transfer
- **Professional Services**: Foreign service providers entering Chinese market subject to licensing procedures
- **Telecommunications/Media**: Restricted sectors face licensing requirements but with procedural protections

### Strategic Considerations
- Technology transfer prohibition provides legal basis to resist coerced IP sharing (though enforcement uncertain)
- 20-30 day timeline enables supply chain planning (add buffer for complexity)
- Administrative review and litigation provide recourse for improper denials, but success uncertain
- Equal access principle may support foreign applicants challenging discriminatory treatment
- Hearing requirement for major public interest decisions provides participation opportunity
