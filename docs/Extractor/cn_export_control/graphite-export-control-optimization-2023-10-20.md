## Summary
The Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs announced optimized export control measures for graphite items, effective December 1, 2023. The regulation restricts exports of high-purity synthetic graphite materials and natural flake graphite derivatives, requiring export permits while removing temporary controls on other graphite products previously regulated under 2006 Announcement No. 50.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs
- **Effective Date**: 2023-12-01
- **Scope**: Exporters of synthetic graphite materials (purity >99.9%, tensile strength >30MPa, density >1.73g/cm³) and natural flake graphite derivatives including spheroidized and expanded graphite variants

## Key Provisions

**Controlled Items:**

1. **High-Specification Synthetic Graphite:**
   - Purity exceeding 99.9%
   - Tensile strength exceeding 30 MPa
   - Density exceeding 1.73 g/cm³
   - Related products meeting these specifications

2. **Natural Flake Graphite and Derivatives:**
   - Natural flake graphite
   - Spheroidized graphite
   - Expanded graphite variants

**Application Process:**
- Exporters must submit applications through provincial commerce departments to Ministry of Commerce
- Required documentation:
  - Export contracts and copies
  - Technical specifications or testing reports
  - End-user and end-use certificates
  - Importer information
  - Identity documentation for legal representatives and staff

**Approval Authority:**
- Ministry of Commerce conducts reviews within statutory timeframes and issues export licenses
- Exports significantly impacting national security require State Council approval

**Enforcement:**
- Unauthorized exports face administrative penalties and potential criminal liability
- Customs requires export licenses for clearance

**Administrative Change:**
- Supersedes 2006 Announcement No. 50
- Cancels temporary controls on other graphite products previously regulated

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Critical Supply Chain Nodes:**
- Battery manufacturers relying on high-purity synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries
- Steel and metallurgical industries using natural flake graphite
- Electric vehicle supply chain dependent on spheroidized graphite for battery anodes
- Semiconductor manufacturers using expanded graphite for thermal management

**Impact on Global Trade:**
- China produces approximately 70% of global natural graphite and 90% of spheroidized graphite
- Electric vehicle manufacturers face potential supply constraints
- Battery producers must secure long-term supply agreements with approved Chinese exporters
- Alternative suppliers (Africa, Canada) face capacity and quality constraints

**Compliance Timeline:**
- Companies had approximately 40 days to secure export permits before December 1, 2023 effective date
- Existing contracts required retroactive permit applications
- Supply chain disruptions likely in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 during adjustment period

**Strategic Implications:**
- Strengthens China's control over critical battery supply chain materials
- Encourages downstream processing within China
- Incentivizes foreign companies to establish battery production facilities in China
- Aligns with broader critical mineral export control strategy

## Notes
WebFetch successful - full policy content retrieved. This announcement represents a significant regulatory update in China's critical mineral export control framework, particularly impacting the global electric vehicle and energy storage supply chains. The optimization removes controls on lower-specification graphite while tightening restrictions on strategic high-performance materials.
