## Summary
China's Foreign Trade Law establishes the legal framework for export control mechanisms, covering goods, technology, and services trade. The law authorizes the Ministry of Commerce to administer trade restrictions through quotas, licensing, and permit systems for items affecting national security, public health, and international obligations. Most recent amendments were enacted on December 30, 2022.

- **Scope**: Goods import/export, technology transfer, and international service trade

## Key Provisions

### Export Control Framework

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: This foundational law establishes the legal basis for all Chinese export control measures, affecting all companies engaged in trade with China.

**Impact on Supply Chains**:
- Companies must implement comprehensive compliance programs to meet licensing and permit requirements
- Multi-stage approval processes may extend lead times for controlled items
- Enforcement penalties create significant financial and operational risks for non-compliance
- The broad scope of controlled items (nuclear, military, health, environmental, agricultural, cultural) requires cross-functional compliance coordination

**Strategic Considerations**:
- This law provides the legal foundation for specific export control regulations (dual-use items, nuclear, military, etc.)
- Amendments in 2022 indicate ongoing evolution of China's export control regime
- Administrative review mechanisms provide limited recourse but emphasize importance of proactive compliance
