## Summary
The Dutch government announced on September 6, 2024, an expansion of national export control measures targeting advanced semiconductor production equipment, effective September 7. This update broadens the scope of equipment requiring export licenses, building upon controls that took effect on September 1, 2023.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Dutch Government
- **Effective Date**: 2024-09-07
- **Scope**: Advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment; expansion of previously established equipment categories requiring export licenses

## Key Provisions
- **Expanded Equipment Coverage**: More categories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment now require licensing approval for export
- **Regulatory Framework**: Builds upon the September 1, 2023 controls, representing a phased expansion of semiconductor technology restrictions
- **Licensing Requirement**: Export of covered advanced semiconductor production equipment requires government authorization

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This section contains speculative analysis based on available information.*

**Potential Impacts:**
- **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: Companies exporting advanced lithography and deposition equipment from the Netherlands may face additional compliance requirements
- **Asia-Pacific Markets**: Given the concentration of semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan, South Korea, and China, export flows to these regions may experience increased scrutiny
- **Supply Chain Delays**: Additional licensing requirements could extend lead times for semiconductor fab equipment procurement
- **Technology Transfer**: The expansion signals continued coordination among Western nations on semiconductor technology export restrictions
