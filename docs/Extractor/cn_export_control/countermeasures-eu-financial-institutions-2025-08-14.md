## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce issued Order No. 5 on August 13, 2025, imposing countermeasures against two Lithuanian banks (UAB Urbo Bankas and AB Mano Bankas) in response to the EU's inclusion of two Chinese financial institutions in its 18th round of Russia-related sanctions. The order prohibits Chinese organizations and individuals from conducting relevant transactions and cooperation with these entities.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (Minister Wang Wentao)
- **Effective Date**: August 13, 2025
- **Scope**: Two Lithuanian banks added to China's countermeasures list

## Key Provisions

**Legal Basis:**
Implemented under provisions of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China.

**Trigger Event:**
The EU's July 18, 2025 inclusion of two Chinese financial institutions in sanctions related to the 18th round of Russia sanctions, which China views as "a serious violation of international law and basic principles of international relations" that damages Chinese enterprises.

**Countermeasure Entities:**
1. UAB Urbo Bankas (Lithuania)
2. AB Mano Bankas (Lithuania)

**Prohibited Activities:**
Organizations and individuals within China are prohibited from conducting relevant transactions and cooperation with these entities.

**Approval Process:**
The decision was approved by the National Counter-Sanction Coordination Mechanism.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Affected Sectors:**
- Cross-border banking and financial services
- Trade finance involving EU-China transactions
- Payment processing and settlement systems

**Strategic Implications:**
This action demonstrates China's willingness to use its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law as a reciprocal enforcement tool against entities in jurisdictions that impose sanctions affecting Chinese interests. While the direct impact is limited to two small Lithuanian banks, the measure signals:

1. **Escalation Risk**: China's readiness to counter EU sanctions with targeted financial restrictions
2. **Supply Chain Finance**: Potential disruption to trade finance channels involving these institutions
3. **Broader Implications**: Warning to other financial institutions participating in sanctions against Chinese entities

**Business Impact:**
- Companies using these banks for China-related transactions must seek alternative financial channels
- Increased compliance burden for multinational firms operating in both China and EU
- Potential for further tit-for-tat measures affecting financial sector cooperation

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full official announcement retrieved. This represents the first known use of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law specifically targeting EU financial institutions in response to Russia-related sanctions. The choice of Lithuanian banks (relatively small institutions) suggests a calibrated response rather than targeting major EU financial centers.
