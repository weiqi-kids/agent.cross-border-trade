## Summary
China's Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism issued Announcement No. 9 on September 25, 2025, placing three U.S. enterprises on the unreliable entity list with prohibitions on import/export activities and new investments in China. The affected entities include marine technology companies Saronic Technologies, Oceaneering International, and telecommunications firm Aerkomm.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism (Ministry of Commerce)
- **Effective Date**: September 25, 2025 (upon publication)
- **Scope**: Three U.S. companies in marine technology and telecommunications sectors

## Key Provisions

**Legal Basis:**
- Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China
- National Security Law of the People's Republic of China
- Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China
- Unreliable Entity List Regulations

**Listed Entities:**
1. **Saronic Technologies, Inc.** (autonomous maritime systems, defense technology)
2. **Aerkomm Inc.** (aviation and maritime connectivity solutions)
3. **Oceaneering International, Inc.** (offshore engineering, subsea robotics)

**Enforcement Measures:**
1. **Import/Export Ban**: Prohibition on import/export activities related to China (禁止上述企业从事与中国有关的进出口活动)
2. **Investment Ban**: Ban on new investments within Chinese territory (禁止上述企业在中国境内新增投资)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Affected Sectors:**
- Maritime and offshore technology
- Autonomous marine systems
- Subsea engineering and robotics
- Aviation and maritime connectivity
- Defense-related marine applications

**Strategic Implications:**

1. **Dual Control Mechanisms**: This announcement complements the concurrent export control list announcement (No. 51), demonstrating China's use of multiple enforcement tools - export controls for technology outflows and unreliable entity list for broader commercial restrictions.

2. **Sector Focus**: The targeting of marine and subsea technology companies suggests concerns about:
   - Military applications of autonomous maritime systems
   - Underwater surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities
   - Strategic maritime infrastructure

3. **Investment Restrictions**: The prohibition on new investments prevents these companies from establishing or expanding operations in China, limiting technology transfer and operational presence.

**Business Impact:**
- **Saronic Technologies and Oceaneering**: Loss of access to Chinese maritime markets and supply chains, particularly for sensors, electronics, and marine equipment components
- **Aerkomm**: Disruption to connectivity service offerings and equipment sourcing for Asia-Pacific routes
- **Supply Chain Partners**: Chinese suppliers and distributors must terminate business relationships
- **Market Access**: Effectively barred from China's growing offshore energy, maritime infrastructure, and ocean technology sectors

**Comparative Effect:**
Unlike the export control list (which restricts Chinese exports to entities), the unreliable entity list is broader, blocking both imports and exports and preventing the entities from investing or expanding in China.

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full announcement retrieved. This action was announced concurrently with the export control list announcement (No. 51), indicating a coordinated dual-track enforcement approach. The focus on marine and subsea technology companies aligns with China's strategic concerns about maritime security and suggests potential connections to U.S. naval or intelligence activities in the Indo-Pacific region.
