## Summary

The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) reached consensus during its 2024 plenary meeting to clarify and update the dual-use item control list. The modifications involve adjustments to technical parameters and specifications for items subject to export control by NSG member states. This represents ongoing international coordination to refine controls on sensitive nuclear and dual-use technologies.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) — multilateral export control regime
- **Effective Date:** Consensus reached at 2024 plenary meeting (specific implementation dates vary by member state)
- **Scope:** Dual-use items control list — items with both civilian and potential nuclear weapons applications

## Key Provisions

1. **List Modifications:** Member states agreed to "clarify and update" the NSG dual-use item list
2. **Technical Updates:** Adjustments focus on parameters and technical specifications
3. **Consensus-Based:** Changes reflect agreement among all NSG member states during plenary session
4. **Implementation:** Each member state will implement changes according to their domestic legal frameworks

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment (speculative)

**Affected Sectors:** Nuclear technology, advanced materials, precision manufacturing, specialized equipment

**Potential Supply Chain Effects:**
- Exporters of dual-use items on modified list may face updated licensing requirements
- Companies trading in nuclear-related technologies should review updated technical specifications
- Cross-border transactions involving NSG-controlled items may require compliance review
- China, as an NSG member since 2004, will likely incorporate these changes into domestic export control regulations

**Geographic Scope:** All 48 NSG member states, including major nuclear technology exporters (US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Russia, China)

**Compliance Considerations:** Exporters should monitor when member states publish domestic implementing regulations reflecting the NSG list updates
