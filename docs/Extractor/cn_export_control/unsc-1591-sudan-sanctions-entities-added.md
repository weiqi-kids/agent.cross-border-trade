## Summary

The UN Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005) Committee concerning Sudan added 2 entities to its sanctions list on November 8, 2024.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** UN Security Council Committee established pursuant to Resolution 1591 (2005) concerning Sudan
- **Effective Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Scope:** 2 entities added to Sudan sanctions list (specific entity names not provided in source article)

## Key Provisions

1. **Sanctions List Expansion**: Addition of 2 entities to the UNSC 1591 Sudan sanctions list
2. **Sanctions Measures**: Entities subject to measures established under UNSC Resolution 1591 (2005), typically including asset freezes and travel bans (specific measures not detailed in source)
3. **Sudan Context**: Sanctions related to the situation in Darfur, Sudan

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Limited Commercial Impact**: Sudan-related sanctions primarily affect entities involved in conflict-related activities in Darfur; limited direct impact on mainstream global supply chains
- **Financial Sector Compliance**: Banks and financial institutions must screen transactions against updated sanctions list to ensure no dealings with designated entities
- **Due Diligence Requirements**: Companies with Sudan operations or indirect exposure through supply chains should verify counterparties against updated UNSC 1591 list
- **Enforcement Risk**: Transactions with designated entities, even inadvertent, create legal and reputational risks under UN member state sanctions implementation
- **Sectoral Focus Uncertainty**: Without entity details, unable to assess whether sanctions target specific sectors (minerals, oil, arms-related) that might have broader supply chain implications

## Notes

**Limited Information**: Source article provides only basic fact of 2 entities added; does not specify entity names, sectors, or detailed rationale. For operational compliance, consult official UN Security Council sanctions list at https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1591.

UNSC Resolution 1591 (2005) established sanctions regime targeting those responsible for threatening peace, security, and stability in Darfur, Sudan, including arms embargo violators and those committing violations of international humanitarian law.
