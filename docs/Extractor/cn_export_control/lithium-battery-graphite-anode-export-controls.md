## Summary
This announcement establishes comprehensive export controls on three categories of lithium battery supply chain items: high-density lithium-ion batteries and manufacturing equipment, positive electrode materials and production systems, and synthetic graphite anode materials with related technologies. The controls become effective November 8, 2025.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Scope**: Export of specified lithium battery components, materials, manufacturing equipment, and related technologies

## Key Provisions
- **Category 1 - Lithium Battery Items**:
  - High-density lithium-ion battery cells/modules (≥300 Wh/kg)
  - Manufacturing equipment including winding machines and coating systems

- **Category 2 - Positive Electrode Materials**:
  - Iron phosphate cathode materials (≥2.5 g/cm³ density)
  - Precursor hydroxides for cathode production
  - Manufacturing equipment: kiln systems, grinding equipment

- **Category 3 - Negative Electrode Materials**:
  - Synthetic graphite anode materials
  - Production equipment: granulation vessels, graphitization furnaces, coating modification equipment
  - Related production technologies

- **Export Approval Requirements**:
  - Exporters must obtain Ministry of Commerce approval before shipping
  - Proper documentation required on customs declarations
  - Technical parameters must be specified with appropriate classification codes
  - Non-controlled similar items require detailed technical specifications to demonstrate compliance

- **Customs Declaration**: Controlled items must be clearly marked on customs declarations with specific codes and technical parameters

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This assessment represents speculative analysis based on regulatory framework:*

This announcement represents a major escalation in China's strategic control over the lithium battery supply chain, targeting not just finished products but the entire manufacturing ecosystem. The November 8, 2025 effective date provides minimal transition time for affected exporters.

**Immediate Impacts**:
- Foreign battery manufacturers relying on Chinese high-density cells (≥300 Wh/kg) should identify alternative suppliers immediately
- Equipment manufacturers may face 3-6 month delays for first-time exports requiring approvals
- R&D collaborations involving graphite anode technologies may require government clearance

**Strategic Implications**:
- The ≥300 Wh/kg threshold captures next-generation high-energy-density batteries for electric vehicles and aviation applications
- Including manufacturing equipment suggests intent to slow technology diffusion to competing battery industries
- Graphite anode controls complement existing graphite export restrictions, creating comprehensive coverage
- Iron phosphate (LFP) cathode material controls may signal concerns about lower-cost battery technology transfer

**Sector-Specific Concerns**:
- **EV Manufacturers**: May face supply constraints for high-performance battery cells
- **Energy Storage**: Grid-scale storage projects using Chinese LFP batteries may experience procurement delays
- **Aerospace**: High energy density requirements make this sector particularly vulnerable
- **Battery Equipment Makers**: Companies establishing overseas production lines may face technology transfer restrictions

Companies should diversify supplier bases, accelerate domestic production capabilities, and establish pre-approval relationships with Chinese export authorities for ongoing supply arrangements.
