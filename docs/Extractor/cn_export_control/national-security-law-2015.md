## Summary

The National Security Law of the People's Republic of China, enacted by the 12th National People's Congress Standing Committee effective July 1, 2015, establishes a comprehensive framework for safeguarding national security across political, territorial, economic, information, and cybersecurity domains. This foundational law provides the legal basis for export control measures by defining security obligations for citizens and organizations, including reporting requirements for activities that endanger national security and prohibitions on providing resources to entities threatening state security.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2015-07-01
- **Scope**: National-level framework law covering all aspects of state security, including economic security and information security which underpin export control regimes

## Key Provisions

1. **Political and Territorial Integrity**: Establishes principles for protecting China's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity as fundamental national security interests.

2. **Economic Security Framework**: Provides legal foundation for economic security measures, which includes control over sensitive technologies and dual-use goods export.

3. **Information and Cybersecurity**: Establishes framework for protecting information infrastructure and critical data, relevant to technology export controls.

4. **Citizen and Organizational Obligations**:
   - Requirement to "及时报告危害国家安全活动的线索" (promptly report indicators of activities endangering state security)
   - Prohibition on providing resources, facilities, or other assistance to entities or individuals threatening national security

5. **Crisis Management Protocols**: Establishes mechanisms for responding to national security threats, including those arising from unauthorized technology transfers.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*The following analysis is speculative and based on the framework nature of this law:*

This law serves as the **legal foundation** for China's export control regime. Its broad definition of national security enables authorities to:

- Classify emerging technologies (semiconductors, AI, quantum computing) as security-sensitive, subjecting them to export licensing
- Require companies to report suspicious export activities or foreign entity engagement involving controlled items
- Potentially restrict exports to entities deemed threatening to China's economic or technological security
- Justify countermeasures against foreign export control actions as national security protections

**Potential supply chain impacts:**
- Technology companies may face heightened compliance obligations when exporting from China
- Dual-use goods manufacturers should anticipate scrutiny on end-users and end-use declarations
- Foreign entities on unreliable entity lists or subject to Chinese sanctions may experience supply disruptions
- Data security requirements may affect cloud services and cross-border data flows related to manufacturing and logistics

## Notes

WebFetch successful. This is a foundational national security law that provides the overarching legal framework for China's export control system, rather than a specific export control regulation. It was published on the Export Control Information Network as part of the legal framework supporting export control enforcement. The law's broad scope allows for flexible interpretation of security threats, which has implications for technology export restrictions and supply chain controls.
