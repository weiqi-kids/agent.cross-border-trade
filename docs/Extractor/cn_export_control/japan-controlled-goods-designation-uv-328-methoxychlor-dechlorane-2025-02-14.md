## Summary
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry amended METI Notice No. 173 of 2004, adding three new controlled chemical substances—UV-328, methoxychlor, and Dechlorane Plus—to the designated goods list under the Export Trade Control Order, effective February 18, 2025.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-02-18
- **Scope**: Addition of three chemical substances to export-controlled designated goods
- **Legal Basis**: Export Trade Control Order (1949 Cabinet Order No. 378), Article 4(2)

## Key Provisions
**Amended Regulation:**
- Partial revision of METI Notice No. 173 of 2004 regarding designated goods

**Newly Designated Controlled Goods:**

**Item 33:**
- Chemical name: 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol
- Common name: **UV-328** (ultraviolet absorber)
- Application: Polymer stabilizer, plastic additive

**Item 34:**
- Chemical name: 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane
- Common name: **Methoxychlor** (pesticide)
- Application: Insecticide, agricultural chemical

**Item 35:**
- Chemical name: 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,13,13,14,14-dodecachloro-1,4,4a,5,6,6a,7,10,10a,11,12,12a-dodecahydro-1,4:7,10-dimethano dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene
- Common name: **Dechlorane Plus** (flame retardant)
- Application: Additive flame retardant in polymers, cables, electronics

**Control Requirements:**
- These items now require export declaration and licensing
- Must comply with export control procedures under the Export Trade Control Order

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Chemical Industry Impact:**
- Japanese chemical manufacturers exporting these substances must implement licensing procedures
- Affects polymer additives, agricultural chemicals, and flame retardant supply chains

**UV-328 (Item 33):**
- **Use**: UV stabilizer in plastics, coatings, and polymers
- **Impact**: Plastics manufacturers using UV-328 as additive may face supply constraints if sourcing from Japan
- **Rationale**: UV-328 is persistent organic pollutant (POP) candidate; likely environmental/health control

**Methoxychlor (Item 34):**
- **Use**: Insecticide, replacement for DDT
- **Impact**: Limited, as methoxychlor use is already restricted in many countries
- **Rationale**: Persistent environmental contaminant; likely implements international chemical convention obligations

**Dechlorane Plus (Item 35):**
- **Use**: Flame retardant in electronics, cables, building materials
- **Impact**: Electronics manufacturing supply chains if sourcing from Japan
- **Rationale**: Emerging persistent organic pollutant; environmental and health concerns

**Strategic Context:**
- Controls target environmental and health hazards, not strategic/military items
- Likely implements Stockholm Convention or Rotterdam Convention obligations on persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
- Reflects Japan's commitment to international chemical safety frameworks

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Japanese exporters: Immediate licensing requirements as of February 18, 2025
- International buyers: Verify supplier compliance and potential delivery delays
- Downstream users: Assess alternative sourcing or substitute materials

**Industry Sectors Affected:**
- Plastics and polymer manufacturing
- Electronics manufacturing (flame retardants)
- Agricultural chemicals (limited due to existing restrictions)
- Coatings and adhesives

## Notes
- Article successfully fetched via WebFetch
- These are chemical substance controls, distinct from technology/strategic goods controls
- Controls reflect environmental and health policy rather than national security concerns
- All three substances are persistent organic pollutants or candidates
- UV-328 and Dechlorane Plus additions align with international chemical safety trends
- Companies should verify if existing inventory exported before February 18, 2025 is exempt from new requirements
