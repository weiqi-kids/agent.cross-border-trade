## Summary
China's Missiles and Related Items Export Control Regulations establish comprehensive controls to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction delivery systems. The regulations require prior licensing approval for all missile-related exports, mandatory exporter registration, and extensive end-use documentation including guarantees against diversion. National security matters require State Council and Central Military Commission approval without time restrictions.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (Order No. 361)
- **Effective Date**: August 22, 2002
- **Scope**: Missiles, related items, and technology capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction
- **Status**: Note - document indicates "Abolished/Repealed" status (may have been superseded by later regulations)

## Key Provisions

### Export Authorization
- **Mandatory Licensing**: All organizations and individuals require prior licensing approval
- **Prohibition**: "任何单位或者个人不得出口导弹及相关物项和技术" (entities and individuals cannot export without authorization)
- **Registration Requirement**: Only registered exporters may conduct such trade
- **Foreign Trade Authority**: Establishes specific procedures for exporter registration

### Documentation Requirements
Applications must include:
- Identity verification
- Export contracts
- Technical specifications
- End-user certificates
- End-use declarations
- Guarantee documents ensuring items won't be diverted

### Review and Approval Process
- **Standard Review**: Authorities must decide within 45 working days
- **National Security Matters**: State Council and Central Military Commission approval required
- **No Time Restrictions**: National security cases not subject to standard 45-day timeline
- **Discretionary Authority**: Broad scope for denying licenses based on security considerations

### Enforcement and Penalties
Violations include:
- **Criminal Liability**: Smuggling, unauthorized exports
- **Document Fraud**: Forgery or falsification of documentation
- **Procurement Fraud**: Fraudulent license or permit acquisition
- **Administrative Measures**: Fines, permit revocation, business suspension

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Affects aerospace, defense, and dual-use technology sectors involved in propulsion systems, guidance technology, launch systems, and delivery platforms.

**Impact on Supply Chains**:
- **Proliferation Concerns**: Controls target WMD delivery capability, affecting wide range of aerospace and propulsion technologies
- **End-Use Verification**: Guarantee requirements against diversion create extensive compliance obligations
- **Extended Review Times**: 45-day standard review plus unlimited time for national security cases creates planning uncertainty
- **State Council Involvement**: Highest-level approval for sensitive cases indicates strategic importance
- **Registration Barriers**: Only registered exporters can participate, limiting market access
- **Technology Transfer Risk**: Technical specifications requirement exposes intellectual property during application process

**Strategic Considerations**:
- This regulation reflects China's commitments under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) principles
- The joint State Council/Central Military Commission approval authority for sensitive cases demonstrates strategic oversight
- "Abolished/Repealed" status suggests this regulation may have been superseded by the 2020 Export Control Law or other specific regulations
- The catch-all provision for "related items and technology" provides broad authority to control dual-use items
- Criminal liability provisions create significant personal risk for executives involved in unauthorized exports
- The requirement for non-diversion guarantees effectively requires end-to-end supply chain visibility

## Notes
WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content. **IMPORTANT**: The document indicates "Abolished/Repealed" status, suggesting this regulation may have been superseded by more recent export control legislation, likely the 2020 Export Control Law. The substantive requirements likely remain in effect through successor regulations. Users should verify current legal status and identify any replacement regulations.
