## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*Note: The following represents analytical interpretation of potential impacts based on the regulatory framework.*

**Short-term impacts:**
- Enhanced compliance requirements for exporters of dual-use items, requiring documentation of end-users and end-use commitments
- Increased processing time for export permits due to multi-factor review process
- Need for supply chain visibility to ensure downstream compliance with re-export restrictions

**Medium-term impacts:**
- Potential supply disruptions for foreign buyers on the end-user blacklist
- Increased compliance costs for maintaining credit records and documentation systems
- Risk of market access restrictions for entities violating Chinese export control requirements

**Long-term strategic considerations:**
- Alignment requirement with China's international commitments and reciprocal arrangements
- Potential for temporary controls on emerging technologies affecting technology supply chains
- Extraterritorial reach may affect multinational corporations' global operations involving Chinese-origin controlled items

## Notes

This is China's first comprehensive export control law, consolidating previously fragmented regulations across multiple sectors. The law establishes the State Council's authority to coordinate export control work and oversee the control list system. It also provides legal basis for reciprocal measures and countermeasures against foreign discriminatory export control practices. WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content.
