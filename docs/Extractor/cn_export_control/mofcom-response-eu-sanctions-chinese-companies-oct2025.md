## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce strongly objected to the European Union's 19th round of sanctions against Russia, which for the first time included Chinese companies, specifically targeting major Chinese refineries and petroleum traders. The spokesperson characterized the sanctions as lacking international legal basis and warned of potential countermeasures to protect Chinese companies' legitimate rights.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-29 (statement date; EU sanctions effective date not specified)

**Scope:** Chinese enterprises listed in the EU's 19th round of Russia-related sanctions, including refineries and petroleum traders

## Key Provisions

1. **Opposition to Unilateral Sanctions:** China characterizes the EU sanctions as "unilateral sanctions lacking international legal basis" and states that "欧盟不顾中方多次交涉和劝阻,一意孤行" (the EU proceeded unilaterally despite repeated Chinese representations and appeals).

2. **Harm to Bilateral Relations:** The statement asserts the sanctions violate EU-China leadership consensus and harm bilateral economic cooperation and global energy security.

3. **Demand for Reversal:** China demands the EU "immediately cease listing Chinese enterprises" (立即停止将中国企业列单).

4. **Countermeasure Warning:** China "reserves the right to take necessary countermeasures to protect Chinese companies' legitimate rights and safeguard energy security" (保留采取必要措施的权利,维护中国企业合法权益和能源安全).

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High Impact (speculative):** The listing of Chinese refineries and petroleum traders in EU sanctions creates significant compliance challenges for global energy supply chains. European companies trading with the listed Chinese entities face potential penalties under EU sanctions law. Chinese energy companies may face secondary sanctions risk when conducting international transactions denominated in euros or involving EU financial institutions. This development may accelerate the bifurcation of global energy markets and drive Chinese energy companies toward alternative payment systems and non-EU trading partners. Companies in the energy sector should conduct immediate sanctions screening and assess exposure to the listed Chinese entities.

## Notes

This marks the first time Chinese companies have been included in EU Russia-related sanctions packages, representing a significant escalation in the use of economic sanctions affecting China-EU trade relations. The statement's emphasis on energy security suggests China views the sanctions as threatening critical supply chains. Companies should monitor for potential Chinese countermeasures that may affect EU entities operating in China.
