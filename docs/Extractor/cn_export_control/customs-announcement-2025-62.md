## Summary

The Ministry of Commerce announces new export controls on rare earth related technologies, including mining, smelting, separation, metal refining, magnetic materials manufacturing, and rare earth secondary resource recycling technologies. The controls apply to both technology transfers abroad and provision to foreign entities within China, requiring export licenses approved by the State Council under China's Export Control Law.

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (商务部)
- **Legal Basis**: Export Control Law of the PRC, Regulations on Export Control of Dual-Use Items
- **Approval Level**: State Council
- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-09 (date of publication)
- **Control Codes**: 1E902.a (technologies and carriers), 1E902.b (production line assembly, commissioning, maintenance, repair, upgrade technologies)
- **Scope**: Rare earth mining, smelting and separation, metal refining, magnetic materials manufacturing, rare earth secondary resource recycling

## Key Provisions

### Article I: Controlled Items Requiring Export License

1. **Technologies and Carriers** (Control Code: 1E902.a):
   - Rare earth mining technologies
   - Smelting and separation technologies
   - Metal refining technologies
   - Magnetic materials manufacturing technologies
   - Rare earth secondary resource recycling technologies
   - Related technical data carriers (design drawings, process specifications, process parameters, processing programs, simulation data, etc.)

2. **Production Line Technical Services** (Control Code: 1E902.b):
   - Assembly, commissioning, maintenance, repair, and upgrade technologies for production lines in the above areas

3. **Catch-All Control**:
   - Export of non-controlled goods, technologies, or services that the exporter knows are used for or substantially contribute to overseas rare earth activities requires license application under Article 12 of the Export Control Law and Article 14 of the Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations

4. **Definitions**:
   - "Rare earth", "smelting and separation", "metal refining", "rare earth secondary resources" follow definitions in the Rare Earth Management Regulations of the PRC
   - "Magnetic materials manufacturing" refers to samarium-cobalt, neodymium-iron-boron, and cerium magnet manufacturing technologies
   - "Technologies and carriers" include technical data such as design drawings, process specifications, process parameters, processing programs, simulation data

### Article II: Scope of Exporters and Export Activities

- **Exporters**: Chinese citizens, legal persons, unincorporated organizations, and all natural persons, legal persons, and unincorporated organizations within China
- **Export Definition**: Transfer of controlled items from China to overseas, or provision to foreign organizations or individuals within or outside China, including:
  - Trade exports
  - Intellectual property licensing
  - Investment
  - Exchange, donation, exhibition, display
  - Testing, inspection
  - Aid, teaching, joint R&D
  - Employment or hiring
  - Consulting
  - Any other form of transfer or provision

### Article III: License Application and Compliance Requirements

- Exporters must apply to MOFCOM following Article 16 of the Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- Technology export applications require submission of "Statement on Transfer or Provision of Export-Controlled Technologies" (Attachment 1)
- Provision of controlled technologies to foreign entities located within China requires "Statement on Provision of Export-Controlled Technologies Within China" (Attachment 2)
- Exporters must comply with Article 18 requirements on license use and reporting obligations

### Article IV: Exporter Due Diligence

- Exporters must enhance compliance awareness and understand the performance indicators and main uses of goods, technologies, and services to determine if they are dual-use items
- If unable to determine whether items are controlled or whether activities are subject to control, exporters may consult MOFCOM

### Article V: Prohibition of Intermediary Services

- No entity or individual may provide intermediary, brokerage, agency, freight, express delivery, customs declaration, third-party e-commerce platform, or financial services for violations of this announcement
- Service providers must proactively inquire whether clients' export activities are subject to this announcement and whether they have applied for or obtained licenses
- Licensed exporters must proactively present license documents to service providers

### Article VI: Exemptions and Public Domain

- Technologies in the public domain, technologies in basic scientific research, or technologies necessary for ordinary patent applications are not subject to this announcement
- Unauthorized public disclosure of controlled technologies not in the public domain to unspecified recipients after the effective date will be penalized under Article 34 of the Export Control Law

### Article VII: Prohibition of Support to Foreign Rare Earth Activities

- Chinese citizens, legal persons, and unincorporated organizations may not provide any substantial assistance or support to overseas rare earth mining, smelting and separation, metal refining, magnetic materials manufacturing, or rare earth secondary resource recycling activities without permission
- Violations will be penalized according to the Export Control Law and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations

### Article VIII: Implementation and Control List Update

- The announcement is effective from the date of publication (2025-10-09)
- The Export Control List of Dual-Use Items of the PRC is simultaneously updated

### Attachments

1. Guide to Filling Out "Statement on Transfer or Provision of Export-Controlled Technologies"
2. Guide to Filling Out "Statement on Provision of Export-Controlled Technologies Within China"

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Speculative Analysis**:

1. **Global Rare Earth Supply Chain Disruption**: This control significantly restricts technology transfer in the rare earth value chain, potentially limiting foreign entities' ability to develop independent rare earth processing capabilities. China controls approximately 70% of global rare earth mining and 90% of processing capacity, making these technology controls highly impactful.

2. **Magnetic Materials Industry**: The specific inclusion of samarium-cobalt, neodymium-iron-boron, and cerium magnet manufacturing technologies directly affects high-tech sectors including electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, aerospace, and defense applications that rely on rare earth permanent magnets.

3. **Technology Services Sector**: The control of production line assembly, commissioning, maintenance, repair, and upgrade services (1E902.b) restricts technical support for existing overseas rare earth facilities, potentially affecting operational efficiency and expansion plans.

4. **Catch-All Provision Impact**: The knowledge-based catch-all provision requires exporters to assess end-use even for non-controlled items, increasing compliance burden and creating uncertainty for legitimate trade activities involving rare earth applications.

5. **Extraterritorial Reach**: Article VII prohibits Chinese entities from providing "any substantial assistance or support" to overseas rare earth activities without permission, extending control beyond traditional export activities to include investment, employment, consulting, and other forms of engagement.

6. **Domestic Foreign Entity Operations**: Controls on provision to foreign entities within China (Article II, Attachment 2 requirement) may affect foreign-invested enterprises operating in China's rare earth sector and technology transfer within joint ventures.

7. **Compliance Ecosystem**: Article V's prohibition on intermediary services creates a compliance obligation for freight forwarders, customs brokers, financial institutions, and e-commerce platforms, potentially fragmenting service availability for rare earth technology trade.
