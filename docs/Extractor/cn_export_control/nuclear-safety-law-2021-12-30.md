## Summary
China's Nuclear Safety Law establishes comprehensive regulatory framework for nuclear facility safety, nuclear materials protection, radioactive waste management, and emergency response. The law mandates strict licensing, operational standards, and transparency requirements with penalties up to 5 million yuan for violations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2018-01-01
- **Scope**: Nuclear facilities, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, and emergency response procedures

## Key Provisions

### Chapter Structure (94 Articles)
1. **General Provisions (Articles 1-13)**: Aims to ensure nuclear safety and prevent/respond to nuclear incidents
2. **Nuclear Facility Safety (Articles 14-37)**: Covers facility siting, operational licensing, quality assurance, personnel qualifications, and safety standards
3. **Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Waste Safety (Articles 38-53)**: Material protection, waste classification, disposal, and transportation requirements
4. **Nuclear Accident Emergency (Articles 54-62)**: Emergency coordination mechanisms and response procedures
5. **Information Disclosure and Public Participation (Articles 63-69)**: Transparency in nuclear safety information and public involvement
6. **Supervision and Inspection (Articles 70-74)**: Regulatory authority and inspection procedures

### Key Requirements
- Comprehensive licensing system for all nuclear facilities
- Strict personnel qualification standards
- Mandatory quality assurance programs
- Traceability requirements for nuclear materials
- Public disclosure of safety information

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Nuclear Material Supply**: All transfers require licenses and meet stringent protection standards
- **Equipment Manufacturing**: Nuclear facility components must comply with quality assurance requirements
- **Waste Management**: Radioactive waste handling, storage, and disposal face strict classification and tracking requirements

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Nuclear Power Industry**: Operational licensing and safety reviews add significant compliance burden
- **Medical/Industrial Users**: Small-scale nuclear material users subject to same fundamental safety requirements
- **Transportation**: Specialized transport requirements for nuclear materials increase logistics costs

### Strategic Considerations
- Information disclosure requirements enable public scrutiny of nuclear operations
- Emergency response coordination mechanisms require cross-agency cooperation
- International alignment with IAEA standards facilitates technology cooperation
