- Effective date provides transition period for compliance system updates

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Exporters must review controlled items against updated unified list
- Compliance systems require updates to reflect new control list structure

## Notes

This announcement represents a significant administrative reform of China's export control system, consolidating fragmented regulations into a unified framework. The timing—effective December 1, 2024—follows several major export control announcements earlier in 2024 (antimony, graphite, drones, superhard materials), suggesting the unified list incorporates these recent additions.

The inclusion of the National Cipher Bureau as a joint issuing authority indicates full integration of commercial cryptography controls, which were previously governed by separate regulations.

Companies should obtain the full control list PDF attachment and conduct comprehensive reviews of export activities to ensure compliance with the consolidated framework. The transition period before the December 1 effective date provides time for system updates and staff training.
