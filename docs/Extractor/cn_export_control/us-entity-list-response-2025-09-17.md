## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce strongly opposes the U.S. Department of Commerce's September 12, 2025 decision to add multiple Chinese entities across semiconductors, biotechnology, aerospace, and logistics sectors to its export control entity list. The spokesperson characterized these measures as unilateral hegemonic practices that damage legitimate business operations and global supply chains, particularly noting the problematic timing ahead of scheduled U.S.-China trade talks.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce Press Office (商务部新闻办公室)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-09-12 (U.S. announcement)
- **Scope**: Multiple Chinese entities in semiconductors, biotechnology, aerospace, and logistics sectors

## Key Provisions
- **China's Position**: Firmly opposes U.S. misuse of national security concerns and export controls
- **Characterization**: Describes U.S. actions as "unilateral hegemonic practices" prioritizing American interests over other nations' development rights
- **Impact Assessment**: Affects numerous Chinese firms' legitimate business operations and damages global supply chains
- **Timing Concern**: Action taken ahead of September 14 U.S.-China trade talks in Spain
- **Response**: China demands cessation of unjustified suppression and pledges necessary countermeasures

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
This enforcement action directly impacts Chinese companies in critical technology sectors including semiconductors, biotechnology, aerospace, and logistics. The restrictions limit these entities' access to U.S.-origin technology and components, potentially forcing supply chain reconfiguration. The timing suggests escalating U.S.-China technology competition despite ongoing diplomatic engagement, increasing uncertainty for multinational corporations operating across both markets.
