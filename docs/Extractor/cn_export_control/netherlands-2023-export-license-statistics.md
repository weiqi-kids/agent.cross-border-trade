## Summary

The Netherlands issued 898 dual-use export licenses in 2023 (34.63% increase from 2022's 667), with total value rising from over €20 billion to nearly €21 billion. License denials decreased from 32 to 14. Top export destinations outside EU were South Korea (€3.895B), Taiwan (€3.437B), and U.S. (€2.329B); China ranked sixth (€253M).

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation
- **Effective Date:** Report submitted to parliament November 5, 2024 (covering 2023 data)
- **Scope:** Dutch dual-use export licensing statistics for 2023; geographic distribution and value analysis

## Key Provisions

1. **License Volume Growth**: 898 dual-use licenses issued in 2023 vs. 667 in 2022 (+34.63%)
2. **License Value Growth**: Total licensed export value increased from over €20 billion to nearly €21 billion
3. **Denial Rate Decrease**: License denials dropped from 32 (2022) to 14 (2023), indicating either improved compliance or policy shifts
4. **Top Non-EU Destinations (by value)**:
   - South Korea: €3.895 billion (#1)
   - Taiwan (China): €3.437 billion (#2)
   - United States: €2.329 billion (#3)
   - China: €253 million (#6)
5. **Policy Report**: "2023 Netherlands Export Control Policy" (《2023年荷兰出口管制政策》) submitted to House of Representatives

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Semiconductor Equipment Dominance**: South Korea and Taiwan as top destinations strongly suggests ASML and other Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturers drive dual-use export volumes, reflecting Netherlands' critical role in global chip manufacturing supply chains
- **Asia-Pacific Focus**: Top non-EU destinations concentrated in Asia-Pacific (South Korea, Taiwan, U.S. as re-export hub), indicating Dutch dual-use exports heavily weighted toward semiconductor and electronics sectors
- **China Export Constraints**: China ranking #6 with only €253M (vs. Taiwan's €3.437B) reflects impact of semiconductor export controls, particularly EUV lithography restrictions on China implemented by Netherlands
- **Declining Denials**: Drop in denials from 32 to 14 may indicate: (1) exporters better understanding license requirements, (2) policy shift toward more permissive licensing for allied destinations, or (3) self-censoring by exporters avoiding applications likely to be denied
- **License Volume Growth**: 34.63% increase in licenses significantly outpaces normal economic growth, suggesting either: (1) expanded control lists capturing more items, (2) surge in semiconductor equipment exports, or (3) shift from general to individual licenses requiring more applications
- **Strategic Technology Controls**: Data reflects Netherlands' role as gatekeeper for critical semiconductor manufacturing technology, with licensing patterns showing clear differentiation between allied (South Korea, Taiwan) and strategic competitor (China) destinations

## Notes

This annual report provides rare transparency into Dutch dual-use export licensing patterns. The stark contrast between Taiwan (€3.437B) and China (€253M) destinations quantifies the impact of coordinated Western semiconductor export controls. Netherlands' position as home to ASML (monopoly EUV lithography supplier) makes its licensing decisions critical chokepoint in global semiconductor supply chains.

Report title suggests annual publication series; previous years' data provides baseline for trend analysis.
