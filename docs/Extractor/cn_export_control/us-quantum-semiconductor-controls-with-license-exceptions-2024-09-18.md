## Summary
The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security released a temporary final rule on September 5, 2024, implementing export controls on critical and emerging technologies including quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing. The regulation includes license exceptions for international partners based on broad technology agreements.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
- **Effective Date**: 2024-09-06
- **Scope**: Quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and other advanced technologies under multilateral technology agreements

## Key Provisions
- **Temporary Final Rule**: Published September 5, 2024, implementing controls on critical and emerging technologies
- **Technology Coverage**: Specifically addresses quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and other advanced technologies
- **License Exceptions**: Provides exemptions for exports to international partners under broad technology agreements
- **Comment Period**: 60 days from publication for public input
- **Multilateral Coordination**: Implements controls "reached between the U.S. and international partners"

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This section contains speculative analysis based on available information.*

**Potential Impacts:**
- **Allied Nations**: Countries with technology agreements (likely including Japan, Netherlands, South Korea) may benefit from streamlined licensing for quantum and semiconductor technologies
- **Non-Allied Markets**: Exports to countries without such agreements (potentially including China) likely face stricter controls
- **Quantum Computing Industry**: Emerging quantum technology companies may face new compliance requirements for international sales
- **Semiconductor Equipment**: Manufacturing equipment for advanced nodes likely subject to enhanced scrutiny outside partner countries
- **Technology Development**: The two-tier approach (partners vs. non-partners) may create divergent technology access patterns globally
