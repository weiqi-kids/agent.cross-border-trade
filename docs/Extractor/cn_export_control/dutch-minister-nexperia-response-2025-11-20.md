## Summary
China expressed extreme disappointment and strong dissatisfaction with Dutch Economic Minister Karreman's November 13 statement to the Guardian defending his decision on Nexperia. China accused the Netherlands of distorting facts, abandoning legal procedures, and refusing Chinese compromises while creating systemic supply chain risks.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Commerce Ministry News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-20
- **Scope**: China-Netherlands semiconductor dispute escalation

## Key Provisions
- China expressed "extreme disappointment and strong dissatisfaction" with Dutch minister's Guardian interview
- Accused Netherlands of "distorting facts and reversing right and wrong"
- Criticized September 30 administrative order and October 8 court decision as hasty and abandoning legal procedures
- Claimed China offered compromises by exempting civilian-use exports and inviting Dutch officials for consultations
- Accused Nexperia (Netherlands) of refusing supplies to Chinese enterprises and preventing order fulfillment
- Stated Netherlands' actions create systemic risks in semiconductor supply chains
- Emphasized China's willingness to cooperate if Netherlands brings "constructive solutions"

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Escalation Risk**: The harsh diplomatic language and mutual recriminations indicate the dispute is intensifying rather than resolving. Nexperia's refusal to supply Chinese enterprises creates immediate risks for manufacturers dependent on their components. The reference to "systemic risks" suggests China may be considering broader retaliatory measures. Companies in the semiconductor ecosystem should accelerate supply chain diversification and prepare for potential further restrictions from both sides.
