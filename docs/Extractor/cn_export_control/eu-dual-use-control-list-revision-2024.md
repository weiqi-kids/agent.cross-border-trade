## Summary

The European Commission adopted a delegated regulation on September 5, 2024, modifying the EU dual-use items export control list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821 to align with the latest control lists from four major international export control multilateral regimes.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** European Commission (欧盟委员会)
- **Effective Date:** 2024-09-05 (adoption date); delegated regulations typically enter into force after publication in Official Journal and non-objection period
- **Scope:** Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821 (EU dual-use export control regulation); alignment with Wassenaar Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and Australia Group control lists

## Key Provisions

1. **Delegated Regulation Adoption**: European Commission adopted delegated regulation amending Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821
2. **Four Multilateral Regimes Alignment**: Updates ensure EU control list aligns with latest control lists from:
   - Wassenaar Arrangement (conventional arms and dual-use goods)
   - Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) (nuclear materials and technology)
   - Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) (missile-related items)
   - Australia Group (chemical and biological weapons precursors)
3. **Annex I Scope**: Annex I contains the EU's common list of dual-use items subject to export controls
4. **International Harmonization**: Maintains EU alignment with international export control standards and commitments

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Broad Sectoral Impact**: Alignment with four multilateral regimes means updates potentially affect multiple sectors: semiconductors/electronics (Wassenaar), nuclear energy (NSG), aerospace/drones (MTCR), chemicals/pharma (Australia Group)
- **Compliance Timeline Pressure**: EU member states and exporters must update compliance programs, internal control lists, and screening systems to reflect Annex I changes; delegated regulations typically allow limited transition period
- **Emerging Technology Controls**: Wassenaar Arrangement recently added controls on quantum computing, cybersecurity tools, and advanced materials; EU alignment brings these into EU legal framework
- **Export License Implications**: Items newly added to Annex I require export licenses where previously unlicensed; existing license holders may need to verify continued validity under updated categories
- **Intra-EU vs. Extra-EU Impact**: Annex I primarily governs exports outside EU; intra-EU transfers generally exempt, but member states may apply national controls
- **Third-Country Competitiveness**: EU exporters face licensing requirements aligned with international standards; non-regime members may have competitive advantage if not implementing equivalent controls, though risk-based compliance pressures increasingly negate this gap

## Notes

Regulation (EU) 2021/821 is the EU's current dual-use export control regulation, which replaced earlier Regulation (EC) 428/2009. The regulation requires regular updates to Annex I to maintain alignment with international export control regimes.

The "four major international export control multilateral regimes" referenced are: (1) Wassenaar Arrangement, (2) Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), (3) Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and (4) Australia Group. All EU member states participate in these regimes, and EU regulation codifies their control lists into binding EU law.

Specific items added/modified not detailed in source article. For operational compliance, consult official EU delegated regulation once published in Official Journal.
