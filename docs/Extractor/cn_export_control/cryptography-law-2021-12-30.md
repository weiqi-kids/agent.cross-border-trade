## Summary
China's Cryptography Law establishes a three-tier cryptography system (core, general, and commercial) with unified leadership and graded responsibility. The law mandates encryption for state secret transmissions, implements export controls on commercial cryptography affecting national security, and establishes administrative penalties ranging from 10,000 to 3 million yuan for violations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2020-01-01
- **Scope**: Core, general, and commercial cryptography products, services, and systems

## Key Provisions

### Chapter I - General Principles
- Cryptography work follows principles of "unified leadership, graded responsibility, innovative development, and lawful management"
- State Cryptography Administration oversees all national cryptography affairs
- Three-tier classification system for cryptographic technologies

### Chapter II - Core and General Cryptography
- **Article 14**: Information systems transmitting state secrets via wired or wireless communications must use core and general cryptography for encryption protection
- Cryptography work institutions must establish strict security measures and confidentiality protocols
- Special management regime for systems handling classified information

### Chapter III - Commercial Cryptography
- State encourages commercial cryptography research and development
- **Article 28**: Import licensing and export controls apply to commercial cryptography products affecting national security and public interests
- Consumer products exempted from licensing requirements
- Voluntary testing and certification system for commercial products

### Chapter IV - Legal Liability
- Administrative penalties for violations range from warnings to fines (10,000-3,000,000 yuan)
- Asset confiscation possible depending on severity and violation type
- Criminal liability for serious breaches

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
- **Cryptography Product Export**: Products affecting national security require export licenses
- **Encryption System Integration**: Systems transmitting state secrets must use approved cryptography
- **Testing and Certification**: Commercial cryptography products face voluntary but advantageous certification requirements
- **Import Controls**: Foreign cryptography products subject to licensing for certain applications

### Industry-Specific Implications
- **Telecommunications**: Network equipment with encryption capabilities face compliance requirements
- **Financial Services**: Banking systems must use approved cryptographic solutions for sensitive transactions
- **Cloud Services**: Data protection solutions require cryptography compliance
- **IoT/Smart Devices**: Consumer products generally exempted, but enterprise IoT faces scrutiny

### Strategic Considerations
- Export control provision (Article 28) creates trade restrictions similar to US EAR/ITAR frameworks
- Mandatory use of Chinese cryptography for state secrets effectively mandates localization for government contractors
- Consumer product exemption reduces compliance burden for mass-market electronics
- Voluntary certification may become de facto mandatory for market access
