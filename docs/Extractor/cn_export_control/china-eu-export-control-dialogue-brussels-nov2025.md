## Summary

China and the European Union held bilateral export control dialogue and consultations in Brussels on October 31 - November 1, 2025. Both parties engaged in constructive communication on export control matters of mutual concern and agreed to maintain ongoing dialogue to promote stability in China-EU industrial and supply chains.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 安全与管制局 (Safety and Control Bureau, Ministry of Commerce)

**Effective Date:** Not applicable (informational announcement)

**Scope:** China-EU bilateral export control cooperation and dialogue mechanisms

## Key Provisions

1. **Bilateral Meeting Participants:**
   - China: Jiang Qianliang (姜前亮), Director of the Ministry of Commerce Safety and Control Bureau
   - EU: Deputy Director-General Reidonne of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Trade

2. **Meeting Nature:** The parties engaged in "in-depth, constructive communication" (深入、建设性沟通) on export control matters of mutual concern.

3. **Commitment to Ongoing Dialogue:** Both sides agreed to maintain ongoing dialogue and communications (保持沟通交流).

4. **Objective:** Promoting stability and smooth functioning of China-EU industrial and supply chains (促进中欧产业链供应链稳定畅通).

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Low to Medium Impact (speculative):** This dialogue represents a continuation of institutionalized export control cooperation between China and the EU. While this specific announcement does not contain binding commitments or immediate policy changes, the establishment of regular communication channels may reduce regulatory uncertainty for businesses operating across China-EU supply chains. Companies should monitor follow-up announcements for concrete policy adjustments that may result from these consultations. The emphasis on supply chain stability suggests both parties recognize the need to balance security concerns with economic interdependence.

## Notes

This announcement follows a period of heightened export control tensions globally and represents a diplomatic effort to manage differences through dialogue rather than unilateral measures. The meeting occurred shortly before China announced adjustments to its Unreliable Entity List and export control measures targeting US entities, suggesting coordinated diplomacy with major trading partners.
