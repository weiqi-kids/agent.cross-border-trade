## Summary

On August 22, 2024, Ireland's Minister for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, Dara Calleary TD, announced that the 2023 Export Control Act formally took effect. This new legislation modernizes Ireland's export control framework, replacing the previous 2008 Act and related regulations. A new IT system (EAS) was launched simultaneously to streamline export license application procedures.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Government of Ireland, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment
- **Effective Date:** 2024-08-22
- **Scope:** All controlled exports under Ireland's obligations to EU and international export control regimes

## Key Provisions

1. **Legislative Modernization:** The 2023 Export Control Act replaces the 2008 Act and associated regulations
2. **EU and International Compliance:** Designed to ensure Ireland meets commitments to the European Union and international obligations (likely including Wassenaar Arrangement, NSG, MTCR, AG)
3. **Digital Infrastructure:** New Export Authorization System (EAS) launched concurrently
4. **Streamlined Procedures:** EAS aims to improve efficiency of export license application process for Irish exporters

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment (speculative)

**Affected Sectors:** All dual-use goods, military items, and controlled technologies exported from Ireland

**Potential Supply Chain Effects:**
- Irish exporters of controlled items must comply with new regulatory framework and use EAS system
- Companies with Ireland-based manufacturing or distribution may need to update export compliance procedures
- Potential initial administrative adjustments as exporters transition to new IT system
- Modernized framework may improve processing times and transparency compared to 2008 Act

**Geographic Scope:** Ireland (EU member state)

**Trade Partner Implications:**
- Exporters to Ireland should expect continued alignment with EU export control standards
- Ireland's updated framework likely harmonizes more closely with EU Dual-Use Regulation (EU 2021/821)
- No indication of substantive policy changes — primarily procedural and administrative modernization
