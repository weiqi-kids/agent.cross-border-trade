## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce firmly opposes Britain's October 15 announcement of new Russia-related sanctions targeting 11 Chinese firms. China asserts that it strictly regulates dual-use items exports in accordance with law, that normal Sino-Russian business cooperation should not be disrupted, and that Britain's actions lack international legal basis and UN authorization, with negative impacts on bilateral trade relations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce Press Office (商务部新闻办公室)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-15 (UK announcement)
- **Scope**: 11 Chinese firms targeted under UK Russia-related sanctions

## Key Provisions
- **China's Position**: "Resolutely opposes the UK's listing actions against 11 Chinese enterprises under the pretext of Russia"
- **China's Regulatory Stance**: Strictly regulates dual-use items exports in accordance with law and regulation
- **Sino-Russian Relations**: Normal business cooperation between Russian and Chinese enterprises should not be disrupted
- **Legal Critique**: Britain's actions lack international legal basis and UN Security Council authorization
- **Impact Warning**: Negative impacts on bilateral UK-China trade relations
- **China's Demand**: UK must immediately rescind these sanctions
- **Countermeasures**: China pledges to protect its enterprises' legitimate interests

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
The UK's targeting of 11 Chinese firms for alleged Russia-related sanctions violations reflects Western efforts to enforce secondary sanctions against China-Russia trade, particularly in dual-use items. This creates significant compliance challenges for Chinese companies engaged in legitimate trade with Russia, as they face potential restrictions in UK and potentially broader Western markets. The Chinese response emphasizes legal export controls compliance, suggesting these firms are conducting authorized trade that Western countries view as sanctions circumvention. Global supply chains for dual-use technologies face increasing fragmentation as Chinese companies must choose between maintaining Russia business ties or accessing Western markets.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This article demonstrates the expanding Western use of secondary sanctions targeting China-Russia economic ties, and China's firm rejection of such measures as lacking international legal legitimacy. The article does not specify which 11 Chinese firms were sanctioned. China's emphasis on lawful regulation of dual-use exports suggests defensive positioning against accusations of sanctions evasion.
