## Summary

China's Data Security Law, enacted by the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress, establishes a comprehensive national data security framework effective September 1, 2021. The law implements a tiered data classification system with special protections for "core state data," imposes strict cross-border data transfer restrictions, and establishes significant penalties for violations ranging from administrative fines to criminal liability.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress
- **Effective Date**: 2021-09-01
- **Scope**: All entities handling data within China, with particular focus on telecommunications, finance, transportation, healthcare, education, natural resources, and critical information infrastructure operators

## Key Provisions

**Data Classification System**: Establishes tiered protection based on data importance, with "core state data" related to national security and public welfare subject to strictest controls.

**Data Processing Obligations**: Organizations must implement security management systems, conduct risk assessments, establish emergency response protocols, perform continuous monitoring, and report security incidents.

**Cross-Border Data Transfer Controls**: Restricts transfer of important data overseas, with critical infrastructure operators facing heightened requirements including mandatory security reviews for data exports.

**Government Data Management**: State agencies must protect data confidentiality while establishing frameworks for appropriate data openness and platform development.

**Enforcement Framework**: Violations result in warnings, fines (50,000-2,000,000+ yuan), business suspension, license revocation, or criminal prosecution for severe breaches involving core state data.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*The following represents speculative analysis based on the regulatory framework:*

**Export Control Implications**: Companies exporting goods or services to China that involve data processing may face enhanced compliance burdens, particularly in sectors deemed critical infrastructure (telecommunications equipment, cloud services, financial technology).

**Supply Chain Data Flows**: Cross-border supply chain management systems transmitting operational data from Chinese entities may require security assessments and potentially government approval, affecting just-in-time inventory systems and real-time logistics tracking.

**Technology Transfer Restrictions**: The "core state data" classification could be interpreted to restrict exports of certain technologies or data analytics capabilities deemed relevant to national security, potentially impacting joint ventures, research collaborations, and technical support arrangements.

**Compliance Costs**: Foreign entities with Chinese operations or data handling relationships will likely face increased compliance costs for data localization infrastructure, security audits, and legal consultation to navigate the tiered classification system.

**Sectoral Impact Priority**: Highest impact expected in telecommunications, cloud computing, automotive (connected vehicles), healthcare (patient data), and financial services (transaction data).

## Notes

WebFetch successful — full text analysis completed. This foundational law complements China's existing export control framework by establishing data sovereignty principles that intersect with dual-use technology and controlled item regulations. The tiered classification system parallels export control list categorization, suggesting coordinated implementation across trade control regimes.
