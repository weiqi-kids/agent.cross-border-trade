## Summary
This regulation establishes comprehensive management requirements for monitored chemical products within China, categorizing controlled substances into four classes based on their potential use as chemical weapons. The framework imposes strict production, import/export, storage, and reporting requirements with significant penalties for violations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China
- **Effective Date**: 1995-12-27 (original); revised 2011-01-08
- **Scope**: All production, operation, use, import, export, and storage of monitored chemical products within China's territory

## Key Provisions
- **Classification System**: Establishes four classes of monitored chemicals, from those directly usable as chemical weapons to specific organic compounds
- **Production Restrictions**: Class I chemicals limited to small designated facilities for research, medical, pharmaceutical, or protective purposes only
- **Licensing Requirements**: Classes II-IV require special permits; new facility construction requires provincial and national approval
- **Import/Export Controls**: Restricted to State Council-designated units with documented end-use certifications
- **Reporting Obligations**: Organizations producing, operating, or using monitored chemicals must file reports with the State Council chemical industry oversight department
- **Storage Requirements**: Specialized warehouses with strict inventory controls and mandatory theft reporting
- **Penalty Structure**: Fines ranging from ¥50,000 to ¥200,000 depending on violation severity

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
*This assessment represents speculative analysis based on regulatory framework:*

This regulation likely creates significant compliance barriers for foreign companies seeking to source chemical products from China. The licensing and reporting requirements, combined with end-use certification mandates, may extend supply chain lead times by 2-4 weeks for first-time transactions. Companies in pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and advanced materials sectors should anticipate enhanced due diligence requirements from Chinese suppliers. The designated unit requirement for import/export activities may limit supplier options and potentially increase costs through reduced competition.
