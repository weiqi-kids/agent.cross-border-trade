## Summary
China announced comprehensive prohibition of all dual-use items exports to Japanese military users, military purposes, and any end-users that would enhance Japan's military capabilities. This decision was triggered by Japanese leaders' statements on Taiwan issues hinting at possible military intervention, invoking China's Export Control Law and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2026-01-06
- **Scope**: All dual-use items exports to Japan for military purposes or capability enhancement

## Key Provisions
- Japanese leaders made erroneous statements on Taiwan issues, hinting at possible military intervention
- Violated China's sovereignty principles
- **Policy Decision**: Prohibit all dual-use items exports to:
  - Japanese military users
  - Military purposes
  - Other end-users that would enhance Japan's military capabilities
- Legal basis: Export Control Law and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- **Legal Consequences**: Organizations and individuals from any country or region that violate restrictions by transferring Chinese dual-use items to Japanese entities will face legal liability
- Extraterritorial enforcement: Applies to third-party transfers, not just direct China-Japan exports

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Severe New Restriction with Broad Scope**: This represents China's most comprehensive export control action against Japan in recent years. The prohibition extends beyond direct military users to any end-users enhancing military capabilities, creating significant compliance challenges. The definition of "enhance military capabilities" is ambiguous and could affect civilian companies in aerospace, electronics, advanced materials, and other dual-use sectors. The extraterritorial provision targeting third-party transfers creates compliance risks for multinational supply chains involving both Chinese and Japanese entities. Companies should conduct urgent reviews of Japan-bound dual-use exports and implement strict end-use verification.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This policy marks a significant escalation in China-Japan trade tensions, triggered by political statements on Taiwan rather than trade disputes. The timing (January 2026) and severity suggest this is part of broader geopolitical positioning.
