## Summary

The Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs jointly issued Announcement No. 55 of 2025, implementing export controls on six categories of superhard materials and related production equipment, effective November 8, 2025. The controlled items include synthetic diamond micropowder, single crystals, wire saws, grinding wheels, DCPCVD equipment, and associated process technology.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** Ministry of Commerce (商务部) and General Administration of Customs (海关总署)

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-08

**Scope:** Six categories of superhard materials:
- Synthetic diamond micropowder (2C902.a) — average particle size ≤50 μm
- Synthetic diamond single crystals (2C902.b) — particle size >50 μm and ≤500 μm (excludes decorative/jewelry use)
- Synthetic diamond wire saws (2C902.c) — with specified technical parameters
- Synthetic diamond grinding wheels (2C902.d) — with defined hardness and speed specifications
- DCPCVD equipment (2B005.b) — direct current arc plasma jet chemical vapor deposition apparatus
- DCPCVD process technology (2E902)

---

## Key Provisions

1. **Legal Basis:** Export Control Law, Foreign Trade Law, Customs Law, and Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations

2. **Licensing Requirement:** Exporters must obtain permission from the commerce department before exporting these items

3. **Customs Declaration:** Accurate declaration required whether commodities constitute controlled items

4. **Technical Specifications:** Each controlled category has detailed technical parameters defining control thresholds

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** High

**Affected Industries:**
- Semiconductor manufacturing (diamond tools for wafer processing)
- Precision machining (wire saws for cutting hard materials)
- Industrial abrasives (grinding wheels for metal/stone processing)
- Advanced materials production (CVD equipment manufacturers)

**Geographic Considerations (speculative):**
- Major export destinations for Chinese synthetic diamond products include Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America
- Companies in semiconductor supply chains may face procurement challenges
- Alternative suppliers in Russia, Ireland, and synthetic diamond producers globally may see increased demand

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Exporters must establish pre-export license application procedures
- End-user verification and supply chain traceability systems required
- Technical specifications review needed for all shipments

## Notes

This announcement represents a significant expansion of China's export control regime into advanced manufacturing materials. The inclusion of CVD technology controls suggests concerns about strategic technology transfer. The effective date provides a two-month transition period for industry compliance.
