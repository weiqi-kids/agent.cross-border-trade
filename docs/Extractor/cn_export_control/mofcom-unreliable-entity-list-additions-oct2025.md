## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce announced the addition of Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Company, TechInsights, and affiliated organizations to the Unreliable Entity List. The entities were cited for military cooperation with Taiwan, hostile statements about China, and assistance in suppressing Chinese enterprises, with actions taken under multiple legal authorities.

## Key Details

**Issuing Authority:** 商务部新闻办公室 (Ministry of Commerce News Office)

**Effective Date:** 2025-10-09

**Scope:** Foreign entities engaged in military cooperation with Taiwan, anti-China activities, and suppression of Chinese enterprises

## Key Provisions

1. **Entities Added to Unreliable Entity List:**
   - Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Company (反无人机系统技术公司)
   - TechInsights
   - Affiliated organizations of the above entities

2. **Grounds for Listing:**
   - Military cooperation with Taiwan
   - Making hostile statements about China
   - Assisting in suppressing Chinese enterprises

3. **Legal Authority:** Actions were taken under three laws:
   - Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China (对外贸易法)
   - National Security Law (国家安全法)
   - Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (反外国制裁法)
   - Provisions from the "Unreliable Entity List Regulations" (不可靠实体清单规定)

4. **Reassurance to Law-Abiding Entities:** The statement clarified that "诚信守法的外国实体完全无需担心" (law-abiding foreign entities need not worry), emphasizing China welcomes legitimate foreign investment and commits to providing "稳定、公平和可预期的营商环境" (stable, fair, and predictable business environment).

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Medium to High Impact (speculative):** The addition of Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Company and TechInsights to the Unreliable Entity List restricts these entities' ability to conduct business in China. Companies working with these entities on China-related projects should assess compliance risks. TechInsights is known for semiconductor reverse engineering and analysis, suggesting China is targeting entities involved in technology intelligence that may support export control enforcement against Chinese firms. The reference to "affiliated organizations" creates uncertainty about which subsidiaries or partners may be implicitly covered. Companies in the semiconductor analysis, defense technology, and Taiwan-related sectors should conduct enhanced due diligence on counterparties.

## Notes

This announcement demonstrates China's use of the Unreliable Entity List as a tool to penalize entities engaged in Taiwan-related defense activities and those perceived as supporting technology restrictions against Chinese companies. The simultaneous invocation of three legal frameworks (Foreign Trade Law, National Security Law, Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law) indicates the severity of the perceived violations.
