## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce responded to concerns about Ascentech Semiconductor (Nexperia), criticizing Dutch administrative interference that disrupted global semiconductor supply chains. China announced export exemptions on November 1 to stabilize supply and called for the Netherlands to adopt constructive solutions while protecting Chinese enterprises' legitimate interests.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-04
- **Scope**: Netherlands-China semiconductor trade, global semiconductor supply chain

## Key Provisions
- Dutch administrative order on September 30 improperly interfered with semiconductor company's internal affairs
- Dutch court ruling stripped Chinese enterprises of shareholding rights, causing serious harm to legitimate interests
- Dutch parent company halted wafer supply on October 26, disrupting global semiconductor production
- China announced export exemptions on November 1 to stabilize supply chain
- China urged Netherlands to cease enterprise interference and seek constructive solutions

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Critical Impact**: The halting of wafer supply from the Dutch parent company to its Chinese subsidiary creates immediate disruption risks for global semiconductor manufacturing. China's export exemption policy aims to maintain stability, but the ongoing dispute could lead to prolonged supply chain fragmentation in the semiconductor sector. This affects downstream manufacturers relying on Ascentech/Nexperia components globally.
