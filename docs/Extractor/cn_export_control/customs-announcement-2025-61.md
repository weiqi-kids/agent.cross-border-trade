## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce announces new export controls requiring foreign entities to obtain Chinese export licenses before re-exporting certain rare earth items that contain Chinese-origin rare earth materials or were produced using Chinese rare earth technologies. The regulation covers items with as little as 0.1% Chinese rare earth content by value and applies to specific end-uses including semiconductor manufacturing and military applications.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (商务部)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-12-01 (for sections 1(1) and 1(2)); 2025-10-09 (for section 1(3))
- **Scope**: Foreign organizations and individuals re-exporting items containing/integrating Chinese-origin rare earth materials, items produced using Chinese rare earth technologies, or Chinese-origin rare earth items listed in Annex 1

## Key Provisions

### Licensing Requirements for Foreign Exporters
Foreign entities must obtain dual-use item export licenses from China's MOFCOM before exporting to third countries (outside China):

1. **Items manufactured abroad containing Chinese rare earth materials** (Annex 1, Part 1) that are incorporated into items listed in Annex 1, Part 2, where Chinese rare earth materials constitute ≥0.1% of the value
2. **Items produced abroad using Chinese rare earth technologies** in mining, smelting/separation, metal smelting, magnetic material manufacturing, or rare earth secondary resource recycling
3. **Chinese-origin rare earth items** listed in Annex 1

### End-Use and End-User Restrictions
Applications will be **denied in principle** for:
- Exports to foreign military end-users
- Exports to entities listed on China's export control watch lists or concern lists (including subsidiaries with ≥50% ownership)
- End-uses involving weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, or military purposes

### Case-by-Case Review Required For:
Exports destined for:
- R&D/production of ≤14nm logic chips or ≥256-layer memory chips
- Manufacturing equipment, testing equipment, and materials for the above semiconductor processes
- R&D of AI with potential military applications

### Humanitarian Exception
Exports for emergency medical care, public health emergencies, or natural disaster relief do not require licenses but must be reported to MOFCOM within 10 working days via email (jingwaibaogao@mofcom.gov.cn), with commitment that items will not harm China's national security.

### Application Procedures
- Foreign exporters apply via MOFCOM's dual-use item export license system: http://ecomp.mofcom.gov.cn
- Applications must comply with Article 16 of China's Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations
- All documents must be in Chinese
- Foreign entities may apply directly or through Chinese enterprises, intermediaries, chambers, or associations
- Consultation available via email: jingwaizixun@mofcom.gov.cn

### Compliance Requirements for Chinese Exporters
Chinese domestic exporters of Annex 1, Part 1 items must:
- Declare final destination country/region at customs
- Issue a "Compliance Notice" to foreign importers/end-users per the attached compliance guidance

Foreign exporters must also issue "Compliance Notices" to downstream recipients when transferring controlled items.

### Implementation Timeline
- Sections 1(1) and 1(2): Effective 2025-12-01
- Section 1(3): Effective immediately upon publication (2025-10-09)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Critical Impact Areas** *(Assessment based on regulatory text)*:

1. **Global Rare Earth Supply Chains**: The 0.1% value threshold creates extraterritorial reach over virtually any manufactured product containing trace amounts of Chinese rare earth materials. This likely affects permanent magnets, catalysts, polishing compounds, phosphors, and battery materials globally.

2. **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: The specific focus on ≤14nm logic chips and ≥256-layer memory chips indicates China is targeting advanced semiconductor production. Rare earth materials are critical for semiconductor manufacturing processes (polishing, deposition, etching). Foreign fabs using Chinese-origin rare earth compounds (cerium oxide polishing slurries, high-purity scandium/yttrium for sputtering targets) may need Chinese re-export licenses.

3. **Technology Transfer Controls**: Section 1(2) extends controls to items produced using Chinese rare earth extraction and processing technologies, not just materials. This creates compliance uncertainty for foreign rare earth operations that may have received technical assistance, equipment, or know-how from Chinese sources.

4. **Compliance Burden**: Foreign entities must now determine Chinese rare earth content by value (≥0.1%), track technology provenance, implement "Compliance Notice" requirements throughout supply chains, and potentially apply for Chinese licenses even for intra-foreign transactions. This administrative burden may drive supply chain reconfiguration.

5. **Strategic Sectors**: The regulation's focus on military end-uses, advanced semiconductors, and AI development aligns with broader strategic technology competition. Rare earth permanent magnets are essential for defense systems (guidance systems, jet engines, satellites), EVs, wind turbines, and industrial motors.

**Likely Industry Responses** *(Speculative)*:
- Accelerated diversification away from Chinese rare earth sources (Australian, US, Canadian rare earth development)
- Enhanced due diligence and supply chain traceability systems to verify rare earth origin
- Potential reshoring of rare earth processing to avoid technology-provenance uncertainty
- Development of rare earth-free or rare earth-reduced technologies where feasible

Content retrieved via curl HTML parsing. Original WebFetch failed. Article includes two PDF attachments: (1) Item List (Annex 1) defining controlled rare earth materials and products, and (2) Compliance Notice Guidance template. Full regulatory impact depends on reviewing Annex 1 to determine specific rare earth materials and product categories covered. This regulation represents China's first explicit extraterritorial export control mechanism requiring foreign entities to obtain Chinese licenses for re-exports, marking a significant expansion of China's export control enforcement jurisdiction.
