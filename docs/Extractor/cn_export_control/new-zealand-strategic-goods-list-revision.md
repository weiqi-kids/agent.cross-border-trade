## Summary

New Zealand's Minister of Foreign Affairs approved an updated Strategic Goods List (NZSGL) effective November 12, 2024, containing 278 updates including 231 clarifications/editorial changes and 47 substantive modifications. New controls added for semiconductor technology and quantum computing technology.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade
- **Effective Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Scope:** New Zealand Strategic Goods List (NZSGL); 278 total updates with 47 substantive changes including new controlled items in semiconductor and quantum computing sectors

## Key Provisions

1. **Total Updates**: 278 modifications to the Strategic Goods List
2. **Clarification Changes**: 231 revisions for clarification and editorial purposes, not changing existing control scope
3. **Substantive Changes**: 47 revisions involving additions, deletions, or modifications of controlled items
4. **New Control Areas**:
   - Semiconductor technology (半导体技术)
   - Quantum computing technology (量子计算技术)
5. **Immediate Effect**: Changes took effect on approval date (November 12, 2024)

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **Semiconductor Supply Chains**: New semiconductor technology controls likely target advanced lithography, chip design tools, or specialized manufacturing equipment, affecting New Zealand suppliers to Asian markets (particularly China)
- **Quantum Technology**: Quantum computing controls align with Five Eyes coordination on emerging technologies; may affect New Zealand research institutions and quantum technology exporters
- **Alignment with Allies**: Timing and scope suggest coordination with Australia, U.S., and other Five Eyes partners on critical technology export controls
- **Compliance Transition**: Immediate effective date (no grace period) requires exporters to rapidly assess whether existing licenses cover newly controlled items or if new applications are needed
- **Limited Direct Impact**: New Zealand's relatively small export control footprint means global supply chain impact limited primarily to specific niches (specialized scientific instruments, research equipment)
- **Research Collaboration**: New controls may affect international research partnerships involving controlled quantum or semiconductor technologies

## Notes

The 47 substantive changes represent approximately 16.9% of total updates, indicating targeted adjustments rather than wholesale list restructuring. The addition of semiconductor and quantum computing controls reflects global trend of tightening restrictions on critical/emerging technologies. New Zealand as Five Eyes member typically aligns export controls with Australia, U.S., Canada, and UK.
