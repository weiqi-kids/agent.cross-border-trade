## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce imposed sanctions on five American subsidiaries of South Korean company Hanwha Ocean in response to U.S. Section 301 investigation measures targeting China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors that took effect on October 14. The subsidiaries allegedly assisted and supported U.S. government investigations, leading to their designation on China's countermeasures list with prohibitions on domestic transactions and cooperation.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (商务部)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-15 (responding to U.S. measures effective 2025-10-14)
- **Scope**: Five U.S. subsidiaries of Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. (韩华海洋株式会社)

## Key Provisions
- **Grounds for Sanctions**: Hanwha's American subsidiaries "assisted and supported U.S. government investigations" of China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors under Section 301
- **Countermeasure Designation**: Subsidiaries placed on China's countermeasures list
- **Prohibition**: Domestic organizations and individuals prohibited from conducting related transactions or cooperation with listed subsidiaries
- **Call for Correction**: Ministry urges U.S. and involved enterprises to respect international rules, cease harmful actions, and correct their approaches regarding Chinese interests
- **Section 301 Context**: Responds to U.S. trade investigation measures targeting Chinese maritime industries

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
This enforcement action represents China's direct retaliation against a South Korean company's U.S. operations for participating in American trade investigations—a novel approach that extends secondary sanctions beyond traditional U.S. or European targets. Hanwha Ocean is a major global shipbuilder and defense contractor, and this action creates compliance dilemmas for multinational corporations with operations spanning China, the U.S., and allied countries. The targeting of subsidiaries specifically for cooperation with U.S. trade investigations signals China's willingness to impose costs on third-country companies that support U.S. policy measures, potentially forcing companies to choose between Chinese and U.S. market access in maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This represents an escalation in China's countermeasures strategy by targeting a South Korean company's U.S. subsidiaries for cooperation with American government investigations. The action demonstrates China's expanding use of economic coercion tools and willingness to create complex compliance challenges for multinational corporations operating across geopolitical fault lines.
