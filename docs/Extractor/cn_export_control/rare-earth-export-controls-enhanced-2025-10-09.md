## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce announced two significant export control measures on October 9, 2025, targeting rare earth materials and technologies. Announcement 2025-61 imposes controls on overseas rare earth-related items containing Chinese components that have been redirected for military applications, while Announcement 2025-62 extends controls to rare earth-related technologies following illegal acquisition by foreign entities for military purposes.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (商务部) with State Council approval
- **Effective Date**: 2025-10-09
- **Scope**: Rare earth materials containing Chinese components (Announcement 2025-61) and rare earth-related technologies (Announcement 2025-62)

## Key Provisions
- **Announcement 2025-61 (Materials)**:
  - Controls imposed on "certain overseas rare earth-related items containing Chinese components"
  - Targets foreign entities that redirected Chinese rare earth materials for military applications
  - Includes transition periods for compliance
  - Licensing exemptions for humanitarian purposes (emergency medical care, disaster relief)
  - State Council approval obtained

- **Announcement 2025-62 (Technologies)**:
  - Export controls extended to rare earth-related technologies
  - Responds to illegal acquisition by foreign organizations for military applications
  - Protective measures to prevent proliferation

- **Policy Approach**: Balances security concerns with supply chain stability through bilateral dialogue mechanisms

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
These measures represent China's most significant rare earth export control expansion in recent years, directly leveraging its dominant position in global rare earth supply chains. Announcement 2025-61 targets downstream products containing Chinese rare earth components, potentially affecting electronics, defense systems, and renewable energy technologies manufactured outside China. Announcement 2025-62's technology controls restrict knowledge transfer for rare earth processing and separation—capabilities China has spent decades developing. The humanitarian exemptions suggest China seeks to avoid reputational damage while maintaining strategic leverage. Global manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supply chains face immediate compliance challenges and medium-term pressure to diversify sourcing or develop alternative materials.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This represents a major policy development with substantial global supply chain implications. Rare earths are critical for advanced electronics, defense systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy technologies. China produces approximately 60% of global rare earth supply and controls over 85% of processing capacity, giving these controls significant strategic weight.
