## Summary
China's Nuclear Dual-Use Items Export Control Regulations established a comprehensive licensing framework to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation while facilitating peaceful nuclear cooperation. The regulations covered equipment, materials, software, and technology listed in the control list, requiring government permits and recipient guarantees against nuclear explosion use or unauthorized transfers. Authorities could temporarily control unlisted items when proliferation risks were identified. This regulation has been repealed.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (Order No. 245)
- **Effective Date**: June 10, 1998 (revised January 26, 2007)
- **Scope**: Nuclear dual-use equipment, materials, software, and related technology listed in Export Control List
- **Status**: [已废止] Repealed - superseded by later regulations

## Key Provisions

### Core Purpose
- Prevent nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear terrorism
- Facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation
- Implement international nuclear non-proliferation commitments

### Controlled Items
- Equipment, materials, software, and related technology
- Items specified in Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technology Export Control List
- Catch-all provision for unlisted items with identified proliferation risks

### Licensing System
- **Permit Requirement**: "The State implements a permit system for nuclear dual-use items and related technology exports"
- **Government Permission**: All exports require prior authorization
- **Review Timeline**: Ministry of Commerce must decide within 45 working days
- **Multi-Agency Coordination**: Customs monitors actual shipments

### Recipient Guarantees
Recipients must pledge:
- Items will not be used for nuclear explosion purposes
- Items will not be used for purposes other than declared final uses
- Items will not be transferred to unauthorized third parties
- End-use verification and compliance with stated purposes

### Scope Expansion Mechanism
- **Temporary Controls**: Authorities could control unlisted items if nuclear proliferation risks identified
- **Catch-All Provision**: Flexibility to respond to emerging proliferation threats
- **Discretionary Authority**: Enables real-time response to changing security environment

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Administrative Oversight**: Ministry of Commerce manages approvals
- **Customs Monitoring**: Tracks actual shipments and exports
- **Penalties**:
  - Warnings for minor violations
  - Fines up to five times the illegal transaction amount
  - Potential criminal prosecution for serious violations
- **Graduated Enforcement**: Tiered approach based on violation severity

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Affected nuclear power industry, isotope producers, radiation equipment manufacturers, specialized materials suppliers, nuclear research institutions, and nuclear technology providers.

**Impact on Supply Chains** (Historical Context):
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Controls extended beyond physical items to include software and technology transfers
- **End-Use Certification**: Recipient guarantees created multi-stage verification requirements
- **45-Day Review**: Extended procurement planning cycles for nuclear-related items
- **Catch-All Risk**: Unlisted items could be controlled if proliferation concerns identified, creating uncertainty
- **Multi-Agency Coordination**: Ministry of Commerce and Customs both involved, requiring dual compliance
- **Technology Transfer Restrictions**: Software and know-how transfers subject to same controls as physical items

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Repealed Status**: No longer in effect, likely superseded by 2020 Export Control Law
- **Nuclear Non-Proliferation**: Reflects China's commitments under Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines
- **Peaceful Use Emphasis**: Balanced proliferation prevention with support for peaceful nuclear development
- **Catch-All Precedent**: The unlisted items provision established principle later adopted in broader export control law
- **Five-Times Penalty**: Severe financial penalties created strong compliance incentive
- **Current Framework**: Substantive controls continue under newer legal architecture

## Notes
WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content. **IMPORTANT**: This regulation has been officially repealed [已废止]. Nuclear dual-use export controls remain in effect under the 2020 Export Control Law and implementing regulations for nuclear items. The framework established by this regulation - including the control list approach, recipient guarantees, 45-day review timeline, and catch-all provisions - has been incorporated into China's current export control system. The catch-all mechanism for unlisted items was particularly innovative and has become a standard feature of modern export control regimes globally.
