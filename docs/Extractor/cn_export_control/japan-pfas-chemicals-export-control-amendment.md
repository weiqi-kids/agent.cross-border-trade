**Confidence:** High

## Summary

Japan's METI proposed amendments on October 3, 2024, to add specific PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals to export control list, based on July 10, 2024 Chemical Substances Control Law implementation order. Public comment period: October 3 - November 1, 2024.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority:** Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) / 日本经济产业省
- **Effective Date:** Draft proposal stage; public comment period October 3 - November 1, 2024; final implementation date to be determined
- **Scope:** Addition of specific PFAS chemicals to export control list pursuant to Export Trade Control Order (輸出貿易管理令) Article 4, Paragraph 2

## Key Provisions

1. **Regulatory Basis**: Amendment based on "Chemical Substances Control and Manufacturing Management Law Implementation Order" (《化学物质审查和制造管理法实施令》) issued July 10, 2024
2. **New Controlled Substances**:
   - **Perfluorocarboxylic acids** (全氟羧酸) with branched structure and 8 carbon atoms, and their salts
   - **Perfluorooctanoic acid-related substances** (全氟辛酸相关物质), specifically:
     - Perfluorooctyl iodide (全氟辛基碘烷)
     - 8:2 Fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2氟调聚醇)
     - Specific C15 perfluoroalkyl compounds convertible to controlled perfluoro substances (特定的十五氟烷基化合物,可转化为受管制的全氟物质)
3. **Public Comment Period**: October 3, 2024 - November 1, 2024
4. **Control Objective**: Strengthen export controls on emerging fluorochemical substances

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*[Speculative Analysis]*

- **PFAS Supply Chain Disruption**: New controls on PFAS chemicals align with global regulatory trend (EU PFAS restrictions, U.S. PFAS regulations); Japanese exporters of fluorochemicals face additional licensing requirements
- **Semiconductor and Electronics Impact**: PFAS chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing (photoresists, etching agents) and electronics (water/oil repellent coatings); controls may affect supply to fab operators outside Japan
- **Industrial Applications**: 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol used in textile treatments, firefighting foams, and surface coatings; export controls may disrupt supply chains in these sectors
- **Environmental Alignment**: Controls reflect environmental concerns over persistent PFAS chemicals; likely coordinated with Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
- **Precursor Chemical Focus**: Inclusion of "convertible" compounds (可转化为受管制的全氟物质) suggests controls target precursors that can be transformed into regulated PFAS, addressing potential circumvention
- **Regional Impact**: Asian markets historically important for Japanese chemical exports; controls may particularly affect exports to Southeast Asia, China, and other developing markets

## Notes

This amendment represents intersection of environmental regulation and export control, adding PFAS chemicals to dual-use control framework based on domestic chemical safety law. The July 10, 2024 Chemical Substances Control Law implementation provided the regulatory foundation, with export controls following as secondary measure.

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are "forever chemicals" subject to increasing global regulatory scrutiny due to environmental persistence and health concerns. Japan's move to control exports aligns with international efforts under Stockholm Convention and follows similar restrictions in EU and U.S.

Public comment period standard for Japanese regulatory process; final controls expected to take effect in early 2025 after comment review and formal promulgation.
