- **Effective Date**: Not specified; still in public consultation phase
- **Scope**: Export control list additions for semiconductors and additive manufacturing, plus catch-all control policy revisions

## Key Provisions
**New Controlled Items:**
- Semiconductor-related items (specific technical parameters not detailed in summary)
- Additive manufacturing-related items (specific equipment/technologies not specified)

**Policy Revisions:**
- Amendments to catch-all control policies, which govern exports of unlisted items that may contribute to weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons programs
- Specific revisions not detailed in summary article

**Consultation Process:**

**Information Limitations:**
- Summary article does not include specific item lists, technical parameters, or complete policy text
- Detailed information requires accessing METI official website

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Semiconductor Supply Chains:**
- Japan is critical supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials
- New controls likely target advanced lithography, deposition, etching, or inspection equipment
- May coordinate with U.S. and Netherlands controls on chip equipment exports
- Potential impact on Japanese suppliers to Chinese semiconductor industry

**Additive Manufacturing:**
- Japan has advanced 3D printing capabilities for metals and ceramics
- Controls likely address metal additive manufacturing for aerospace/defense applications
- May affect Japanese equipment exports to emerging manufacturing hubs

**Catch-All Control Implications:**
- Expanded catch-all controls increase due diligence requirements for exporters
- Exporters must assess end-use and end-user risks even for unlisted items
- Heightened compliance burden for Japanese trading companies and manufacturers

**Strategic Context:**
- Aligns with G7 coordination on technology export controls
- Follows similar measures by U.S., Canada, New Zealand
- Part of broader allied effort to restrict strategic technology flows

**Timing Considerations:**
- Consultation phase suggests implementation in Q2 2025
- Companies should participate in comment process to influence final rules
- Allows preparation time for compliance system updates
