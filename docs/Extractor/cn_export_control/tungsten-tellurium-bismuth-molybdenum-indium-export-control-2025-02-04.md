## Summary
China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs issued Announcement 2025 No. 10, establishing export controls on five critical materials (tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium) effective February 4, 2025. The controls apply to specific forms of these materials, their alloys, compounds, and related production technologies, requiring exporters to obtain licenses to safeguard national security and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce & General Administration of Customs (商务部 & 海关总署)
- **Effective Date**: February 4, 2025
- **Scope**: Five critical materials and their derivatives used in advanced manufacturing and defense applications

## Key Provisions

**1. Tungsten Items:**
- Ammonium paratungstate, tungsten oxide, and tungsten carbide
- Solid tungsten (≥97% purity or specific alloy compositions) capable of machining into cylinders, tubes, or blocks
- Tungsten-nickel-iron and tungsten-nickel-copper alloys meeting density and strength requirements
- Production technology and technical data

**2. Tellurium Items:**
- Metal tellurium
- Tellurium compound single/polycrystalline products (cadmium telluride, cadmium zinc telluride, cadmium mercury telluride)
- Related production technology

**3. Bismuth Items:**
- Metal bismuth and products
- Bismuth germanate, triphenyl bismuth, and related compounds
- Production technology

**4. Molybdenum Items:**
- Molybdenum powder (≥97% purity, ≤50μm particle size) for missile components

**5. Indium Items:**
- Indium phosphide, trimethyl indium, triethyl indium
- Production technology

**Licensing Requirement:**
Exporters must obtain licenses from the Commerce Department per applicable export control regulations.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**High-Risk Sectors:**
- Semiconductor manufacturing (indium, tellurium compounds)
- Advanced aerospace and defense (tungsten alloys, molybdenum powder)
- Renewable energy (tellurium for solar cells, cadmium telluride photovoltaics)
- Electronics and displays (indium for ITO coatings)

**Strategic Implications:**
This announcement expands China's export control regime to cover critical materials essential for high-tech manufacturing. Companies sourcing these materials from China will face:
- Extended lead times due to licensing requirements
- Potential supply disruptions if licenses are denied
- Need for supply chain diversification
- Increased costs for compliance and alternative sourcing

**Industries Affected:**
- Electronics manufacturing (semiconductors, displays)
- Defense contractors (aerospace components, missile systems)
- Solar energy producers (photovoltaic cells)
- Advanced materials processing

## Notes
WebFetch status: Successful. Full article content retrieved and analyzed. The announcement represents a significant expansion of China's export control framework, aligning with similar controls on gallium, germanium, and rare earth elements implemented in 2023-2024. This suggests a broader strategy to leverage control over critical materials supply chains.
