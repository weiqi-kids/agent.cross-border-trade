## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Impact Level:** Medium

**Affected Industries:**
- Cross-border payments and trade finance
- International banking and financial services
- EU-China trade settlement services

**Geographic Considerations (speculative):**
- Both targeted banks are Lithuanian financial institutions
- Chinese companies conducting trade with EU counterparts must identify and avoid using these banks for settlements
- Alternative EU banking channels will see increased demand from Chinese clients
- Third-country financial institutions may face pressure to clarify their relationships with listed entities

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Chinese banks must screen and block transactions involving the two designated institutions
- Companies must review existing banking relationships and payment channels
- Alternative correspondent banking arrangements must be established for affected trade routes
- Documentation of compliance with prohibition may be required

## Notes

This represents China's use of counter-sanctions authority in response to extraterritorial application of EU sanctions. The action demonstrates China's willingness to employ financial countermeasures in response to perceived overreach in sanctions regimes. The focus on Lithuanian banks may reflect broader geopolitical considerations related to EU-China-Russia relations.
