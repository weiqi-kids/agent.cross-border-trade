## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[SPECULATIVE]** Although this regulation is abolished, its historical impact and replacement framework have ongoing supply chain implications:

1. **Regulatory Continuity Risk:** The abolishment likely reflects supersession by China's unified Export Control Law (effective December 2020), but transitional gaps may create compliance uncertainty for nuclear industry operators.

2. **Licensing System Evolution:** Companies with legacy licenses under this framework must verify coverage under the new Export Control Law and Nuclear Export Control Regulations to avoid inadvertent violations.

3. **Technology Transfer Scrutiny:** The abolishment does not diminish scrutiny on nuclear dual-use technologies; enforcement may have intensified under the broader Export Control Law framework with expanded extraterritorial reach.

4. **End-Use Certificate Requirements:** Historical end-use certification practices established under this regulation likely persist as MOFCOM continues to require end-user verification for sensitive dual-use exports.

5. **International Compliance Coordination:** Foreign entities involved in nuclear cooperation with Chinese partners should verify replacement regulatory references to ensure ongoing compliance with China's non-proliferation commitments under international treaties.

## Notes

- **Abolishment Context:** This regulation was likely superseded by the Export Control Law of the People's Republic of China (中华人民共和国出口管制法), which entered into force on December 1, 2020, and established a unified export control framework covering nuclear, military, dual-use, and other controlled items.
- **Nuclear-Specific Framework:** Separate Nuclear Export Control Regulations (核出口管制条例) continue to govern strategic nuclear materials, while this regulation historically covered civilian nuclear dual-use items.
- **Document Type:** This is a reprint/archival document (转载) maintained on MOFCOM's export control information portal for historical reference.
- **Current Framework:** Practitioners should reference the Export Control Law (2020) and updated MOFCOM Control Lists for current nuclear dual-use export compliance requirements.
