## Summary
Following November 18-19, 2025 consultations in Beijing, the Netherlands announced it would suspend its administrative order under the Goods Availability Act. China welcomed this as a first step but noted it falls short of full revocation and that the Dutch court ruling stripping Wentai Technology of control remains an obstacle.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-18 to 2025-11-19 (consultation dates)
- **Scope**: China-Netherlands semiconductor dispute resolution framework

## Key Provisions
- Chinese and Dutch government departments conducted two rounds of face-to-face consultations in Beijing on November 18-19, 2025
- China emphasized Netherlands bears responsibility for semiconductor supply chain disruptions
- Netherlands announced it would "suspend the administrative order issued by the Dutch economic minister under the Goods Availability Act"
- China welcomed the suspension as a first step but noted it falls short of fully "revoking the administrative order"
- Identified Dutch court ruling stripping Wentai Technology of control over Nexperia as continuing obstacle
- Called for canceling administrative intervention and supporting enterprise-level dispute resolution
- Both parties agreed to support companies resolving disputes through lawful negotiation while protecting investor rights

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Partial Progress with Structural Issues Remaining**: The Dutch suspension of the administrative order provides temporary relief and demonstrates diplomatic progress. However, the distinction between "suspension" and "revocation" creates uncertainty, and the court ruling on ownership remains unresolved. This two-track approach (government suspension + enterprise negotiation) may enable gradual normalization, but the fundamental control issues could trigger future disputes. Companies should view this as stability improvement rather than full resolution.

## Notes
Successfully fetched via WebFetch. This article shows concrete progress from bilateral consultations, but China's careful language about "first step" and continuing obstacles indicates significant work remains.
