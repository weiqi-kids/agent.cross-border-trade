## Summary
China's Commercial Cryptography Management Regulations establish comprehensive state control over cryptographic technology and products for non-classified information. The regulations designate commercial cryptography technology as state secrets and implement mandatory licensing for research, production, sales, and import/export. Only state-designated units may produce cryptographic products, and all users must use state-approved products exclusively.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: State Council of the People's Republic of China (Order No. 273)
- **Effective Date**: October 7, 1999
- **Scope**: Encryption protection and security authentication technology/products for information not involving state secrets

## Key Provisions

### Foundational Classification
- Commercial cryptography technology is designated as **state secrets**
- Applies to encryption protection or security authentication technology and products for non-classified information
- Specialized state control over research, production, sales, and use

### Administrative Structure
- **National Authority**: National Cryptography Management Committee and its office oversee nationwide management
- **Regional Authority**: Provincial-level bodies handle delegated responsibilities
- Centralized control system with hierarchical implementation

### Production Controls
- **Exclusive Designation**: Only state-designated units may conduct cryptographic research and production
- **Technical Requirements**: Producers must possess adequate technical capacity
- **Quality Standards**: Quality assurance systems must meet specified standards
- **Pre-approval System**: Production authorization required before commencement

### Sales Restrictions
- All sales require prior approval through licensing system
- Sellers must register end-user information
- Mandatory reporting to authorities
- State-approved products only

### Import/Export Controls
- Foreign cryptography products require state approval
- Equipment containing cryptographic technology requires import authorization
- Export activities are restricted
- State approval required for cross-border transactions

### User Restrictions
- Organizations and individuals must use **only** state-approved commercial cryptographic products
- **Prohibited**: Domestically developed non-approved alternatives
- **Prohibited**: Foreign-produced alternatives
- Mandatory compliance for all users

### Enforcement Mechanisms
- Product confiscation for unauthorized activities
- Fines up to three times illegal gains
- License revocation for serious violations
- Applies to unauthorized production, sales, or import/export

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Affects all companies and individuals using encryption or security authentication technology in China, including cybersecurity products, secure communications, financial systems, and IoT devices.

**Impact on Supply Chains**:
- **Market Access Barrier**: Foreign cryptography products face mandatory approval process, creating significant entry barriers
- **Technology Localization**: Effective requirement to use Chinese state-approved cryptographic technology within China
- **Compliance Complexity**: Companies operating in China must implement separate cryptographic solutions from global operations
- **Supply Chain Bifurcation**: Cannot use globally standardized encryption products; must maintain China-specific versions
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Restriction to state-designated producers limits supplier options and competitive pricing
- **Audit Requirements**: End-user registration and reporting creates surveillance obligations for sellers

**Strategic Considerations**:
- The classification of commercial cryptography as "state secrets" gives authorities broad discretionary power
- User restrictions effectively mandate technology localization for any encryption-dependent operations in China
- Global companies face dilemma: comply with Chinese cryptography requirements or maintain global standardization
- The approval system for foreign products creates regulatory uncertainty and potential rejection risks
- Enforcement penalties create significant financial exposure for non-compliance
- This regulation has implications for cloud computing, telecommunications, financial services, and industrial IoT sectors

## Notes
WebFetch successfully retrieved full article content. This regulation is particularly significant for technology companies as it creates a mandatory localization requirement for cryptographic technology. The designation of commercial cryptography as "state secrets" provides legal basis for broad government oversight and restricts market access for foreign encryption products. Companies must carefully assess whether their products contain cryptographic functionality that would trigger these requirements.
