## Summary
China responded to Dutch Economic Minister Carsons's November 6 statement on Nexperia semiconductor, emphasizing that concrete actions to restore supply chain stability remain absent. China reiterated its position that Dutch administrative interference caused the disruption and welcomed Dutch request for discussion visits to China.

## Key Details
- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce News Office
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Scope**: China-Netherlands semiconductor dispute, global semiconductor supply chain

## Key Provisions
- Ministry noted Dutch Economic Minister's November 6 statement but emphasized lack of concrete actions
- China positioned supply chain disruption as originating from Dutch actions
- China announced export exemptions on November 1 for qualifying related exports
- Requested Dutch positions "move beyond rhetoric to substantive constructive proposals and actual measures"
- Called for ceasing administrative interference in corporate operations
- China accepted Dutch economic department's request for discussion visits to China

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment
**Ongoing Tension with Dialogue Opening**: While tensions remain high, China's acceptance of Dutch visit request signals willingness to negotiate. The export exemptions provide partial relief for supply chain continuity, but full resolution requires addressing the fundamental ownership and control issues. Semiconductor manufacturers should maintain contingency sourcing strategies while monitoring bilateral negotiations.
