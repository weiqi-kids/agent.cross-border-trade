## Summary

This regulation, issued by the State Council on August 22, 2002 (Order No. 361), established China's missile export control framework for missile equipment, materials, and related technologies. The regulation is now **abolished (已废止)** and has been superseded by newer export control frameworks. It originally aimed to prevent the proliferation of delivery systems capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction through a mandatory export license system and strict enforcement mechanisms.

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**[SPECULATIVE]** While this regulation is now abolished, its historical existence and subsequent replacement indicate:

- **Evolution of Controls:** China's export control system has evolved from sector-specific regulations (missiles) to more comprehensive frameworks, likely including the 2020 Export Control Law
- **Supply Chain Legacy:** Companies that operated under this framework would have needed to transition compliance systems to newer regulations
- **Current Implications:** Missile-related exports are now governed by updated legislation; exporters must ensure compliance with current frameworks rather than this abolished regulation
- **Proliferation Commitment:** The existence and replacement of this regulation demonstrates China's ongoing commitment to non-proliferation obligations, which continues to affect dual-use technology and defense-related supply chains

## Notes

- This regulation is explicitly marked as **已废止 (abolished)** on the source website
- The control framework has been superseded by newer legislation, likely integrated into China's comprehensive Export Control Law (2020)
- Historical document useful for understanding the evolution of China's export control regime
- Current missile-related export controls should be verified against active legislation
