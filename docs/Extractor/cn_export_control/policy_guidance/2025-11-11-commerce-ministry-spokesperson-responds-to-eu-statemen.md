## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson responded to European Commission statements regarding Nexperia semiconductors, attributing global semiconductor supply chain disruptions to the Netherlands and encouraging prompt reversal of relevant measures. The spokesperson highlighted China's concrete exemptions for compliant civilian-purpose exports while welcoming continued European engagement.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM)
- **Effective Date**: N/A (Q&A response, not a regulatory action)
- **Scope**: China-EU-Netherlands semiconductor trade relations, particularly affecting Nexperia and semiconductor supply chains

## Key Provisions

**Statement Context:**
- Response to European Commission official's statement on Nexperia semiconductor issue
- China's position on semiconductor supply chain disruptions

**Key Points:**
1. **Attribution of Responsibility**: China attributes current global semiconductor supply chain disruptions to the Netherlands
2. **European Engagement**: China notes Europe's commitment to work with the Netherlands on this matter
3. **Call for Action**: Encourages prompt reversal of relevant measures
4. **China's Exemption Measures**: China has adopted concrete measures to exempt compliant exports for civilian purposes
5. **Continued Cooperation**: Welcomes Europe's continued influence in resolving the situation

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

*Note: The following is a speculative analysis based on available information*

**Potential Impacts:**
- **Semiconductor Supply Chain**: The dispute between China and the Netherlands/EU over Nexperia (a major semiconductor company) could affect global semiconductor supply chains, particularly for power semiconductors and automotive chips
- **Export Control Dynamics**: China's mention of exemptions for "compliant civilian-purpose exports" suggests active export control mechanisms that could affect semiconductor trade flows
- **Geopolitical Risk**: The ongoing China-Netherlands-EU semiconductor tensions add uncertainty to tech supply chains, potentially prompting companies to diversify sourcing strategies
- **Bilateral Relations**: The Q&A format and diplomatic tone suggest ongoing negotiations, indicating this may be part of broader trade discussions rather than immediate regulatory action

## Notes

- **Source Type**: News article (转载 - Reprint) from Commerce Ministry News Office
- **Format**: Q&A format, official spokesperson response
- **Fetch Method**: WebFetch (successful extraction)
- **Context**: This appears to be part of ongoing semiconductor trade tensions between China and the Netherlands/EU, specifically related to Nexperia, a Dutch semiconductor company with Chinese ownership
- **Regulatory Significance**: While this is a policy statement rather than a regulatory change, it provides insight into China's stance on semiconductor export controls and bilateral negotiations

**Disclaimer**: This policy interpretation is for reference only and does not constitute legal advice. Entities engaged in semiconductor trade should consult with legal counsel regarding applicable export control regulations.
