## Summary

China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs announced export controls on five heavy rare earth elements (holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium) and their related materials, effective November 8, 2025. The regulation covers metallic forms, alloys, compounds, oxides, and downstream applications including targets, crystal materials, magnets, and optical fiber materials.

## Key Details

- **Issuing Authority**: Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and General Administration of Customs (GAC)
- **Effective Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Scope**: Five heavy rare earth elements and related materials across multiple industrial applications (electronics, optics, energy storage, ceramics)

## Key Provisions

The announcement establishes five new control list entries covering:

**1C909 - Holmium (Ho) and derivatives:**
- Metallic holmium and holmium alloys
- Holmium targets
- Holmium permanent magnets
- Holmium crystal materials
- Holmium magnetocaloric materials and magnetostrictive materials
- Holmium oxides and holmium compounds

**1C910 - Erbium (Er) and derivatives:**
- Metallic erbium and erbium alloys
- Erbium targets
- Erbium crystal materials
- Erbium optical fiber materials
- Erbium hydrogen storage materials
- Erbium ceramic materials

**1C911 - Thulium (Tm) and derivatives:**
- Metallic thulium
- Thulium targets
- Thulium crystal materials
- Thulium luminescent materials

**1C912 - Europium (Eu) and derivatives:**
- Metallic europium and europium alloys
- Europium targets
- Europium luminescent materials
- Europium hydrogen absorption materials

**1C913 - Ytterbium (Yb) and derivatives:**
- Metallic ytterbium
- Ytterbium targets
- Ytterbium crystal materials
- Ytterbium optical fiber materials
- Ytterbium thermal barrier coating materials

**Compliance requirements:**
- Exporters must apply for export licenses according to relevant regulations
- Controlled items must be accurately declared on customs forms
- Items must be marked as "dual-use items" with corresponding export control codes

## Supply Chain Impact Assessment

**Note: This section represents analytical assessment based on available information.**

The export controls on these five heavy rare earth elements may significantly impact global supply chains in several high-tech sectors:

1. **Electronics and semiconductors**: Erbium and ytterbium are critical for optical fiber communications and laser technologies
2. **Defense and aerospace**: Europium and holmium are used in precision optics, radar systems, and magnetic materials
3. **Clean energy**: Holmium permanent magnets are important for wind turbines and electric vehicle motors
4. **Display and lighting**: Europium is essential for LED and display phosphors

China dominates global heavy rare earth production (estimated 60-80% market share for these specific elements). This regulation may:
- Increase procurement costs for downstream manufacturers
- Accelerate diversification efforts by countries seeking alternative suppliers
- Strengthen China's strategic control over critical technology supply chains
- Potentially trigger reciprocal export restrictions from other countries

## Notes

Article content successfully retrieved via WebFetch tool. The announcement follows China's established pattern of expanding export controls on critical minerals and rare earth elements. This is the 57th export control announcement in 2025, indicating an active regulatory period.

The controlled items are classified as dual-use goods under China's export control framework, requiring license approval from MOFCOM before export. Enforcement is conducted jointly by MOFCOM and GAC.
